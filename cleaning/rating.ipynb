Maximum total size of loans of $250,000 per borrower. Loans will be up to three years, with an initial six month repayment holiday. Unsecured finance, meaning that borrowers will not have to provide an asset as security for the loan.

As part of the loan products available, the Government will encourage lenders to provide facilities to SMEs that only have to be drawn if needed by the SME. This will mean that the SME would only incur interest on the amount they draw down. If they do not draw down any funds from the facility, no interest will be charged, but they will retain the flexibility to draw down funds should the need arise. SMEs interested in the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme should approach their financial institution for more information. The Government is working with banks and other eligible lenders to ensure loans are available as soon as possible. While the scheme officially commences from April 2020, your bank or other lenders may be able to provide credit sooner, and still benefit from the guarantee.

Under the AFCA Scheme Authorisation (Additional Condition) Amendment 2020, the AFCA Scheme Rules will be amended to limit AFCA’s ability to consider decisions made by the lender about whether to provide a loan (and the amount of the loan) under the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme and ensure that when making assessments or determinations about a complaint, AFCA gives consideration to the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and the intent and requirements of the Scheme. The amendments to AFCA’s authorisation conditions also apply to decisions made by lenders (all lenders and not only those lenders that are participating lenders under the Scheme) to approve repayment deferrals for businesses in response to the coronavirus crisis. The amendments exclude from AFCA’s remit complaints in relation to decisions by lenders to offer repayment deferrals to businesses impacted by the coronavirus, and any consequential change to the amounts payable under the loan or the duration of the loan. AFCA will amend its Scheme Rules to give effect to this change and provide further guidance for businesses and lenders. The changes to the rules will apply for complaints made after 25 April 2020.

       " 'We are working with clinical software providers to upgrade prescribing and dispensing software so it supports electronic prescribing. We expect this to be available from May 2020. For now, at a telehealth consultation, a prescriber can prescribe medication by writing a paper prescription and providing it to the patient (for example, by post). If this is not practical, a prescriber can instead turn the prescription into an ‘image-based prescription’. This is a digital image of the paper prescription, which can then be sent by the prescriber to the patient’s preferred pharmacy. The Commonwealth has changed legislation to temporarily allow prescribers to create a digital image of the patient’s prescription to support supply of their medicines. This interim arrangement supports telehealth before electronic prescribing becomes available. See our guide on how to write a prescription for your patient during a telehealth consultation. Pharmacists can dispense medications and make Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) claims from the digital image of the prescription sent through by the prescriber. Under the temporary arrangement, patients do not need to sign to acknowledge receipt of supply if it is not practical for them to do so. The pharmacist may sign on behalf of the patient, unless it is not practical for them to do so. If the prescriber has authorised repeats, the pharmacist may create a repeat authorisation and attach it to a print out of the digital image of the prescription. This must be held in the pharmacy for subsequent supply of the medication. See our guide for pharmacists on how to dispense an image-based prescription sent from a prescriber. For image-based prescriptions, prescribers must keep the paper prescription for 2 years (for audit and compliance purposes). Pharmacists must keep the digital image of the prescription for 2 years. Medicines in Schedule 8 and Schedule 4 Appendix D in the Poisons Standard are not part of this interim arrangement, unless specifically permitted by relevant state or territory rules. Supply these medicines according to your state and territory legislation.

States and territories will move between the steps on the pathway at different times, in line with their public health situation and local conditions. They’ll need to maintain strong and prompt control of any outbreaks. The plan gives Australians some certainty about what is to come in the months ahead. In conjunction with advice released by Safe Work Australia, it will help our businesses make decisions about how they can operate in a COVIDSafe way to protect their customers and workers. For each of the major areas of restrictions we have set out 3 key steps between where we are now and where we want to be.  The first steps are cautious ones. It is important we do not move too quickly and risk losing the control we have achieved. Some businesses will start to reopen as we start to allow groups of up to 10 people to be together in homes and in the community. These steps help build our COVIDSafe economy, and also give us more opportunities to connect with family and friends. The second steps in each area will build on this through larger gatherings and even more businesses reopening. As businesses take steps to ensure they are COVIDSafe, we should all feel safe and confident doing some of the things we’ve missed over the last few months. Some higher-risk settings and activities will still be tightly restricted. The third steps are where we start to fully embrace long-term COVIDSafe ways of living and working — the arrangements that will be our ‘new normal’ while the virus remains a threat. Restrictions will be minimised. Gatherings of up to 100 people, interstate travel, growth in community sport, and the possibility of travel to New Zealand, will be underpinned by COVIDSafe practices. With everyone playing their role, we will build a COVIDSafe Australia, where lives and livelihoods are protected.

Where a service charged fees for only one week of care during the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, or in the school holidays between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019, the amount will be calculated on the week in which care occurred and the amount doubled.  Example A Centre Based Day Care (CBDC) service charges $100 for a 10 hour session of care. Therefore, their hourly fee is $10 per hour ($100 ÷ 10 = $10). As $10 is less than the CBDC hourly rate cap of $11.98, $10 is the amount used. On the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, the CBDC service had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care for the fortnight (or five per week) and were charged $100 for a ten hour session (meaning the hourly fee was $10). For that fortnight, the service’s total fees charged were $20,000 (or $10,000 per week). The payment this service will receive is worked out below:  the hourly payment is $5 ($10 x 50% = $5) $5 hourly payment x 10 hour session = $50 payment per session $50 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,000 paid per week.

For all other services–the fortnight starting 17 February 2020. Note: where a service charged fees for only part of the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, or in the school holidays between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019, an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment will be made in accordance with these rules.  For example  An OSHC service that operates in New South Wales provides only vacation care. Therefore, their reference period is 30 September 2019 to 13 October 2019.  For example  An OSHC service provides both vacation care and before and after school care. Their reference period is from 17 February 2020 to 1 March 2020.  For example  An OSHC service operating in New South Wales providing only vacation care, charged fees for one week in the school holiday period between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019. However, the reference fortnight for the service does not change, meaning that the base weekly amount for the provider of the service that is calculated under the Rules, would be effectively half of the amount it would be if the service had operated for the full reference fortnight, instead of only one week. However, the provider of the service will receive an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment to adjust for the week.  The payment amount will be determined based on the total fees charged by the service during a reference fortnight and the reference hourly fee (up to hourly rate cap) for a session of care. For example On the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a Centre Based Day Care service (CBDC) had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care for the fortnight (or five per week) and were charged $100 for a 10 hour session (meaning the hourly fee was $10). This example assumes that all of the children were charged the same amount for the same session lengths. For that fortnight, the service’s total fees charged were $20,000 (or $10,000 per week). The payment this service will receive is worked out below:  the service’s hourly reference fee is $10 (because it is lower than the CBDC hourly rate cap) $10 hourly fee x 50 per cent = $5 paid per hour $5 x 10 hour session = $50 paid per session $50 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,000 paid per week.  For example: On the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a CBDC service had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care per fortnight (or five per week) and was charged $130 for a 10 hour session (meaning the hourly fee was $13). This example assumes that all of the children were charged the same amount for the same session lengths. For that fortnight, the service’s total fees charged were $26,000 (or $13,000 per week). The payment is worked out below:  the service’s hourly reference fee is $11.98 (because their hourly fee is above the CBDC hourly rate cap at $13) $11.98 x 50 per cent = $5.99 paid in business continuity per hour $5.99 x 10 hour session = $59.90 paid in business continuity per session $59.90 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,990 paid to the service per week.

For example:  An OSHC service provides both vacation care and before and after school care. Their reference period is from 17 February 2020 to 1 March 2020.  For example:  An OSHC service operating in New South Wales providing only vacation care, charged fees for one week in the school holiday period between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019. However, the reference fortnight for the service does not change, meaning that the base weekly amount for the provider of the service that is calculated under the Rules would be effectively half of the amount it would be if the service had operated for the full reference fortnight, instead of only one week. However, the provider of the service will receive an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment to adjust for the week.  The reference hourly fee for a session is 50 per cent of the lower of:  the hourly fee for the session; or the relevant Child Care Subsidy hourly rate cap.  For example:  a CBDC service charges $100 for a 10 hour session of care. Therefore, their hourly fee is $10 per hour ($100 ÷ 10 = $10) The CBDC hourly rate cap is $11.98 The reference hourly fee is the hourly fee ($10) because it is lower 50 per cent of the hourly session fee is $5 ($10 x 50 per cent = $5).  For example:  a CBDC service charges $130 for a 10 hour session of care. Therefore, their hourly fee is $13 per hour ($130 ÷ 10 = $13) The CBDC hourly rate cap is $11.98 The reference hourly fee is the CBDC hourly rate cap ($11.98) because it is lower 50 per cent of the hourly reference fee is $5.99 ($11.98 x 50 per cent = $5.99).  *[OSHC]: Outside School Hours Care': 2.0,\n",

These tips can help you save energy working from home. Detailed information on how to save energy is available for households and businesses. Heating and cooling  Around 40% of home energy use can go on heating and cooling. Close off rooms not in use. Set your heating between 18°C and 20°C and your cooling between 25°C and 27°C. For every degree you increase heating and cooling, you increase energy use between 5% and 10%. Dress comfortably. You may need to look professional from the waist up for virtual meetings, but working from home means you can dress for the season.  Computers  Set your monitor to switch off/sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity. Reduce screen brightness to the lowest, visibly comfortable setting. Switch off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when you’re not using them as they use a substantial amount of power by constantly searching for a signal. Close any applications you’re not using. Ensure air vents on computer towers and laptops are kept clear and away from objects. Don’t use active or animated screensavers. Unplug any USB devices (like mice, keyboards, speakers and flash drives) when not in use. Switch off when you’ve finished using your device, or set a timer. If purchasing new equipment, look for the Energy Rating Label on all computer monitors—the more stars the better. Laptops, ultrabooks and notebooks use less energy than desktop computers and can be battery-operated for extended periods.  Mobile phones  Switch off chargers at the wall once charging is complete, and avoid charging overnight if you can.  Reduce screen brightness and turn off live (animated) wallpapers to reduce battery drain. Switch off Bluetooth and GPS when you’re not using them as they use a substantial amount of power by constantly searching for signal. Use aeroplane mode where applicable. Shorten the amount of time for the screen to turn off automatically—try 30 seconds. Delete unwanted apps. The more applications your smartphone has, the faster the power will drain. Set your notification alerts to check at 30 minute intervals (or longer) and close applications when you don’t need them. This can also make a big difference to your data usage.  Office equipment  Turn off your printer, copier, scanner and multi-function devices when you're not using them. ‘Think before you print’ and opt for a printer that prints on both sides of the paper—saving both time and resources. \": 1.0,\n",

       " ' Infographic: Understanding the difference between surgical masks and N95 respiratorspdf icon N95 respirators reduce the wearer’s exposure to airborne particles, from small particle aerosols to large droplets. N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles. Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely. Achieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check each time the respirator is used. Workers must pass a fit test to confirm a proper seal before using a respirator in the workplace. When properly fitted and worn, minimal leakage occurs around edges of the respirator when the user inhales. This means almost all of the air is directed through the filter media. Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales. The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated.

       " 'Yes. To keep patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) healthy and safe, CDC’s infection prevention and control guidance applies to all settings where healthcare is delivered. However, as with any guidance, facilities can tailor certain recommendations to their setting. For example, inpatient psychiatric care includes communal experiences and group activities that may need to continue. If so, these activities might need to be adapted to align with social distancing recommendations. Other recommended infection control measures (for example, ensuring access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cohorting patients with COVID-19 and assigning dedicated staff, or implementing universal source control measures) might not be safe or appropriate to implement in all locations or for all patients due to security and behavioral concerns. Challenges and potential solutions specific to behavioral health settings might include:  Cohorting  Challenge: To prevent transmission, it is generally recommended that patients with COVID-19 be transferred to a separate area of the facility where they can be cared for by dedicated HCP. Because of security concerns or specialized care needs, it might not be possible to cohort certain patients together or change HCP assigned to their care. Potential Solutions: When cohorting is not possible, implement measures to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) between patients with COVID-19 and others on the unit. Ideally, this would include a separate bathroom for COVID-19 patients. Ensure HCP wear all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.   Group Therapy Sessions  Challenge : Group counseling, therapy, and discussion sessions are a critical component of psychiatric treatment and care plans, but the traditional set-up for these activities is not compatible with social distancing recommendations. Potential Solutions : When possible, use virtual methods, or decrease group size so social distancing can be maintained. In the event that COVID-19 is transmitted in the facility, sessions should stop or move to a video discussion forum until additional infection prevention measures are in place to stop the spread.   Cloth Face Coverings  Challenge: For some patients, the use of cloth face coverings or facemasks might pose an additional danger or may cause distress. Some patients may be unable or unwilling to use them as intended. Elastic and cloth straps can be used for strangling oneself or others, and metal nasal bridges can be used for self-harm or as a weapon. Potential Solutions: Consider allowing patients at low risk for misuse to wear cloth face coverings or facemasks, with a preference for those with short ear-loops rather than longer ties. Consider use of cloth face coverings or facemasks during supervised group activities. Ensure that HCP interacting with patients who cannot wear a cloth face covering or facemask are wearing eye protection and a facemask (or a respirator if the patient is suspected to have COVID-19 and respirators are available).   Alcohol-based Hand Sanitizer  Challenge : While alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) containing 60-95% alcohol is an important tool to increase adherence to hand hygiene recommendations, ABHS must be used carefully in psychiatric facilities to ensure it is not ingested by patients. Potential Solutions : Consider not placing ABHS in patients’ rooms in psychiatric facilities, nor in locations where the patients have unsupervised access. Encourage frequent hand washing with soap and water for patients and HCP. Consider providing personal, pocket-sized ABHS dispensers for HCP.   Dining  Challenge : As part of social distancing, communal dining is generally not recommended. However, eating needs to remain supervised due to the potential for self-harm with eating utensils and because commonly used psychiatric medications may cause side effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, dysphagia, hypo- and hypersalivation) that increase choking risk for patients. Potential Solutions : One option is to position staff in patients’ rooms to monitor their dining. Another option is to allow communal dining in shifts so that staff can monitor patients while ensuring they remain at least 6 feet apart. A third option is to have patients sit in appropriately spaced chairs in the hallway outside their rooms so they can be monitored while they eat.   Smoking  Challenge: A higher proportion of psychiatric patients smoke cigarettes compared to the general population. Patients might congregate in outdoor smoking spaces without practicing appropriate social distancing. Potential Solutions: Limit the number of patients allowed to access smoking spacesat the same time, and position staff to observe and ensure patients are practicing appropriate physical distancing.

Current data suggest that close-range aerosol transmission by droplet and inhalation, and contact followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth are likely routes of transmission. Long-range aerosol transmission, such as is seen with measles, has not been a feature of SARS-CoV-2. Potential routes of close-range transmission include splashes and sprays of infectious material onto mucous membranes and inhalation of infectious virions exhaled by an infected person. The relative contribution of each of these is not known for SARS-Co-V-2. Facemasks commonly used during surgical procedures will provide barrier protection against droplet sprays contacting mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but they are not designed to protect wearers from inhaling small particles. N95 and higher level respirators, such as other disposable filtering facepiece respirators, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and elastomeric respirators, provide both barrier and respiratory protection because of their tight fit and filtration characteristics. Respirators should be used as part of a respiratory protection program that provides staff with medical evaluations, training, and fit testing. Although facemasks are routinely used for the care of patients with common viral respiratory infections, N95 or higher level respirators are routinely recommended for emerging pathogens like SARS CoV-2, which have the potential for transmission via small particles, the ability to cause severe infections, and no specific treatments or vaccines. CDC recommendations acknowledge the current challenges with limited supplies of N95s and other respirators. Facilities that do not have sufficient supplies of N95s and other respirators for all patient care should prioritize their use for activities and procedures that pose high risks of generating infectious aerosols and use facemasks for care that does not involve those activities or procedures. Detailed strategies for optimizing the supply of N95 respirators are available on the CDC website. Once availability of supplies is reestablished, the guidance states that the use of N95 and higher level respirators should resume.': 2.9,\n",

Healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. If this responsibility is assigned to EVS personnel, they should wear all recommended PPE when in the room. PPE should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene. After discharge, terminal cleaning may be performed by EVS personnel. They should delay entry into the room until a sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. We do not yet know how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. Regardless, EVS personnel should refrain from entering the vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available). After this time has elapsed, EVS personnel may enter the room and should wear a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. A facemask (if not already wearing for source control) and eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products.

       " 'In general, transport and movement of the patient outside of their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet. If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear all recommended PPE (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene. If the patient is wearing a facemask or cloth face covering, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient’s room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask). After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear all recommended PPE. If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States. Interim guidance for EMS personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is available here. EMS personnel should wear all recommended PPE because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time.': 2.6666666666666665,\n",

To protect patients and co-workers, HCP should wear a facemask at all times while they are in a healthcare facility (i.e., practice source control). Use of a facemask, instead of a cloth face covering, is recommended for HCP, because a facemask offers both source control and protection from exposure to splashes and sprays of infectious material from others.  HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should continue to wear gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), and eye protection (i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face).  HCP working in facilities located in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission are more likely to encounter asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. If COVID-19 is not suspected in a patient presenting for care (based on symptom and exposure history), HCP should follow Standard Precautions (and Transmission-Based Precautions if required based on the suspected diagnosis).

Wear an N95 or higher-level respirator, instead of a facemask, for:  Aerosol-generating procedures (See Which procedures are considered aerosol generating procedures in healthcare settings FAQ) and Surgical procedures that might pose higher risk for transmission if the patient has COVID-19 (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols or involving anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher, such as the nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract) (see Surgical FAQ below). Respirators with exhalation valves are not recommended for source control and should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field    For HCP working in areas with minimal to no community transmission, the universal eye protection and respirator recommendations (described above) for areas with moderate to substantial community transmission are optional. However, HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions. Universal use of a facemask for source control is recommended for HCP.

Tips to improve sleep:  You’ll sleep better if your room is comfortable, dark, cool, and quiet. If it takes you longer than 15 minutes to fall asleep, set aside some time before bedtime to do things to help you relax. Try meditating, relaxation breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation. Before you begin working a long stretch of shifts, try “banking your sleep” – sleeping several extra hours longer than you normally do. After you’ve worked a long stretch of shifts, remember it may take several days of extended sleep (for example, 10 hours in bed) before you begin to feel recovered. Give yourself time to recover. Avoid sunlight or bright lights 90 minutes before you go to sleep, when possible. Exposure to light just before bedtime can cause you to feel more awake.  If you work a night shift and drive home during sunlight hours, try wearing sunglasses to reduce your exposure to sunlight during your drive home. Consider using blackout shades at home when sleeping.   Take naps when you have the opportunity.  A 90-minute nap before working a night shift can help prevent you from feeling tired at work.   Eat healthy foods and stay physically active because it can improve your sleep. Before you go to sleep, avoid foods and drinks that can make falling asleep more difficult:  Avoid alcohol, heavy meals, and nicotine for at least 2–3 hours before bedtime. Don’t drink caffeine within 5 hours of bedtime.    Know what to do if you feel too tired to work safely.  Use a buddy system while you’re at work. Check in with each other to ensure everyone is coping with work hours and demands. Watch yourself and your coworkers for signs of fatigue — like yawning, difficulty keeping your eyes open, and difficulty concentrating. When you see something, say something to your coworkers so you can prevent workplace injuries and errors. Find out if your employer has a formal program to help you manage fatigue on the job. Read information about the program and ask questions so you fully understand your employer’s policies and procedures for helping employees manage fatigue.

Therefore, students experiencing acute asthma attacks should not be attending school without approval by a healthcare provider; if an asthma attack starts at school, a student may need a bronchodilator treatment before being sent home or before an ambulance arrives. The American Lung Association’s Model Policy for School Districts: Stock Bronchodilatorspdf iconexternal icon recommends using inhalers with disposable spacers/mouthpieces and nebulizers with disposable tubing with mask/mouthpieces. Inhalers and nebulizers should be used and cleaned according to the manufacturer’s instructions. During this COVID-19 pandemic, asthma treatments using inhalers with spacers (with or without face mask, according to each student’s individualized treatment plan) are preferred over nebulizer treatments whenever possible. Based on limited data, use of asthma inhalers (with or without spacers or face masks) is not considered an aerosol- generating procedure. Based on limited available data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated by nebulizer treatments are potentially infectious. During this COVID-19 pandemic, nebulizer treatments at school should be reserved for children who cannot use or do not have access to an inhaler (with or without spacer or face mask). Schools should obtain the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff who administer nebulizer treatments. PPE for use when administering nebulizer treatments to students with asthma consists of gloves, medical grade facemask and eye protection. School staff should be trained on when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, where this PPE is stored, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of used PPE. CDC has information on using PPE. Staff should also be trained on how to administer nebulizer treatments. During this COVID-19 pandemic, if a nebulizer treatment is necessary at school for a student, the number of people present in the room should be limited to the student and the staff member administering the treatment. If appropriate based on the student’s age and level of maturity, the staff member could leave the room and return when the treatment is finished. After the nebulizer treatment, this room should undergo routine cleaning and disinfection. CDC has information on how to clean and disinfect and how to prevent asthma attacks triggered by cleaning and disinfecting activities. Use of peak flow meters, including in the school setting, includes forceful exhalation. Forceful exhalation is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure associated with increased risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19. However, for some people with asthma, using a peak flow meter can trigger cough. People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.

       " 'FDA has authorized EUAs for both viral and antibody tests for COVID-19. Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS- CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19. Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS- CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2. If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed.

       " 'Screening employees is an optional strategy that employers may use. There are several methods that employers can use to protect the employee conducting the temperature screening. The most protective methods incorporate social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others), or physical barriers to eliminate or minimize the screener’s exposures due to close contact with a person who has symptoms during screening. Examples to consider that incorporate these types of controls for temperature screening include:  Reliance on Social Distancing : Ask employees to take their own temperature either before coming to the workplace or upon arrival at the workplace. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the employee and:  Ask the employee to confirm that their temperature is less than 100.4o F (38.0o C), and confirm that they are not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath. Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue. Screening staff do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if they can maintain a distance of 6 feet.   Reliance on Barrier/Partition Controls : During screening, the screener stands behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition, that can protect the screener’s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced when the employee sneezes, coughs, or talks. Upon arrival, the screener should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Then:  Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue. Conduct temperature and symptom screening using this protocol:  Put on disposable gloves. Check the employee’s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window. Make sure the screener’s face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening. If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer’s instructions and facility policies. Remove and discard PPE (gloves), and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.    If social distance or barrier controls cannot be implemented during screening, PPE can be used when the screener is within 6 feet of an employee during screening. However, reliance on PPE alone is a less effective control and more difficult to implement given PPE shortages and training requirements.  Reliance on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) : Upon arrival, the screener should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, put on a facemask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves.

Be sure to alert your veterinarian if your pet has trouble breathing, or if you think it is an emergency. While most pets appear to show only mild symptoms or no symptoms, we are still learning about how they are affected by the virus. Even if your pet appears to be feeling better, avoid the following activities until your veterinarian determines that it is safe for your pet to do so or your pet has met the guidance to end their isolation:  Visits to veterinary hospitals, without calling the veterinarian first Visits to human healthcare facilities or schools Visits to parks (including dog parks), markets, or other gatherings such as festivals Visits to the groomer, including mobile grooming salons Visits to pet daycares or boarding facilities Other outings such as playdates, hikes, or visiting other homes, with or without pets Using dog walkers or pet-sitters that live outside your home    Separate your pet from other people and pets in your home   Have the pet stay in a designated “sick room” (such as a laundry room or extra bathroom) if possible, or otherwise be separated from people and other animals. This is the same way a person with COVID-19 would separate from others in their household.   Avoid contact with the pet as much as possible, including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.  If possible, provide a separate litterbox or bathroom area from other pets.  DOGS: If you have a private backyard where your dog can go to the bathroom, do not take them for walks. If you must walk your dog, limit it to bathroom breaks only, stay close to your home, and keep your pet at least 6 feet away from other pets and people. Do not let other people touch or interact with your dog. CATS: Cats should be kept inside. Do not allow cats that have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 to roam outside. CLEANING UP: There is no evidence to suggest that waste from infected pets needs any additional disinfection. Wear gloves when cleaning up after your pet, and place fecal material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before disposing. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet.   Provide bedding, bowls or containers, treats, and toys that are separate from those used by other people or animals in the household.    Disinfect bowls, toys, and other animal care items with an EPA-registered disinfectant and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Soft items like towels, blankets, and other bedding, can be safely laundered and reused. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill animal can be washed with other items.    Monitor your pet’s symptoms It is important to keep track of your pet’s symptoms during home isolation. If you think your pet has new symptoms or is getting worse, call your veterinarian. Pets sick with COVID-19 may have:  Fever Coughing Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Lethargy (unusual laziness or sluggish) Sneezing Runny nose Eye discharge Vomiting Diarrhea  Follow all care instructions from your veterinarian. Your veterinarian may have you keep a written log of your pet’s symptoms. If your pet develops new symptoms or seems to be getting worse, including trouble breathing, you should call your veterinarian right away. Your veterinarian may be able to advise you over the phone or may tell you to bring your pet to their clinic or go to another clinic that can better care for your pet. Protect yourself when caring for a sick pet  Follow similar recommended precautions as for people caring for an infected person at home. If you are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, another household member should care for the pet, if possible. People should wear a cloth face covering and gloves in the same room or area as the sick pet.  Animals should not wear a cloth face covering or mask. Do not try to put a cloth face covering on your pet.   Use gloves when handling the pet’s dishes, toys, or bedding and when picking up feces (poop). Throw out gloves and place waste material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before throwing away in a trashcan lined with a trash bag. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet. Clean your hands regularly throughout the day.  Wash hands: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each Make sure everyone in the home does the same, especially after touching the sick pet or handling their dishes, toys, or bedding. Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Do not touch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.   Clean and then disinfect:  Follow cleaning and disinfecting recommendations found on CDC’s Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products not intended or approved for use on animals. There is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people or other animals from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.

       " 'Grief is a normal response to losing someone important to you. When a loved one dies, it is important for friends and family to be able to share stories and memories of the person and how they influenced their lives. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, “stay at home orders,” and limits to gatherings have affected the ability of friends and family to come together in person and grieve in typical ways. This is true regardless of whether the person’s death was due to COVID-19 or some other cause. Fortunately, most people understand that hosting gatherings now could be dangerous to those who would want to participate. Family and friends are finding alternate ways to connect, support each other, and grieve after their loss. They understand the need to possibly plan for additional memorial services when COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted. Take actions to help you cope with the loss of a loved one Grief is a universal emotion, but no two people experience grief in exactly the same way. Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of grief while practicing social distancing and honoring your loved one include:  Invite people to call you, or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected. Ask family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via phone, video chat, email, text message, photo sharing apps, social media, or mailed letters. Create a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories. Coordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer from within their own households. Some cultures practice a prolonged mourning period with multiple observances, so hosting virtual events now and in-person events later may be in keeping with these practices. Seek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. People who are not part of a faith tradition or religious community can seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends. Use grief counseling services, support groups, or hotlines, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider. Read books about grief and loss. If you have children, read age-appropriate books with them and talk with them about how they are feeling. Take part in an activity that has significance to you and the loved one you have lost, such as planting flowers or a tree or preparing a favorite meal, in memory of your loved one. Review additional information from CDC on loss and grief, and ways to cope with stress and anxiety.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who died of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as people avoiding them or rejecting them. Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger toward other people. Some people may avoid contact with you, your family members, and friends when they would normally reach out to you. You can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with extended family, friends, and others in your community. Practice social distancing while making funeral arrangements  Consider having virtual or phone meetings instead of in-person meetings with funeral home staff, cemetery staff, clergy or officiants, and others to plan funeral arrangements. If you need to meet in person, follow everyday preventive actions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19, such as wearing a cloth face covering, social distancing, washing your hands often, and covering coughs and sneezes. Do not attend in-person meetings if you are sick, might have been exposed to COVID-19, or have higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.  Discuss options for making changes to traditional funeral plans  Discuss your cultural or religious traditions and the funeral wishes of the deceased, if applicable, with family members and the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiants).  Identify any potential concerns and determine options to make changes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preserve traditional practices when it is possible to safely do so, and identify whether modified or new practices could satisfy the needs and values of you and your loved one.   Consider whether it would be acceptable to hold modified funeral arrangements by limiting attendance to a small number of immediate family members and friends shortly after the time of death. Consider holding additional memorial services in the future when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive.  When you are making decisions about who should attend, consider how emotionally difficult social distancing practices might be for attendees (such as keeping at least 6 feet apart and not hugging other attendees who do not live in their household).   Ask the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiant) about resources they may be able to provide, such as:  Virtual funeral services, visitations, and memorial tributes by online video streaming or recorded video.

       " 'As part of routine practices, healthcare personnel (HCP) should be applying Standard Precautions. HCP should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented at the point of care according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities:  consider nonoperative approaches when feasible; minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible; minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures; use the extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; and implement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having HCP wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility.  If surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to all recommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19. This includes:  Using all recommended PPE: an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown.  Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field. If shortages exist, N95 or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e.g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract).   As part of routine practice, HCP should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e.g., smoke evacuation devices).  Because COVID-19 can be transmitted asymptomatically, some infected individuals will not be identified based on clinical signs and symptoms. HCP providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having COVID-19 should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for universal eye protection and respirator use (see FAQ addressing recommended PPE when caring for asymptomatic patients who are not suspected to have COVID-19). HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions.': 3.0,\n",

Consider the following risks for getting or spreading COVID-19, depending on how you travel:  Air travel: Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within 6 feet), sometimes for hours. This may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Bus or train travel: Traveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve sitting or standing within 6 feet of others. Car travel: Making stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and surfaces. RV travel: You may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but RV travel typically means staying at RV parks overnight and getting gas and supplies at other public places. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others. ': 4.0,\n",

More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons. How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials.

       " 'Health differences between racial and ethnic groups are often due to economic and social conditions that are more common among some racial and ethnic minorities than whites. In public health emergencies, these conditions can also isolate people from the resources they need to prepare for and respond to outbreaks.1,13, 14 Living conditions For many people in racial and ethnic minority groups, living conditions may contribute to underlying health conditions and make it difficult to follow steps to prevent getting sick with COVID-19 or to seek treatment if they do get sick.  Members of racial and ethnic minorities may be more likely to live in densely populated areas because of institutional racism in the form of residential housing segregation. People living in densely populated areas may find it more difficult to practice prevention measures such as social distancing. Research also suggests that racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of health disparities. For example, racial residential segregation is linked with a variety of adverse health outcomes and underlying health conditions.2-5 These underlying conditions can also increase the likelihood of severe illness from COVID-19. Many members of racial and ethnic minorities live in neighborhoods that are further from grocery stores and medical facilities , making it more difficult to receive care if sick and stock up on supplies that would allow them to stay home. Multi-generational households , which may be more common among some racial and ethnic minority families6, may find it difficult to take precautions to protect older family members or isolate those who are sick, if space in the household is limited. Racial and ethnic minority groups are over-represented in jails, prisons, and detention centers , which have specific risks due to congregate living, shared food service, and more.  Work circumstances The types of work and policies in the work environments where people in some racial and ethnic groups are overrepresented can also contribute to their risk for getting sick with COVID-19. Examples include:  Critical workers: The risk of infection may be greater for workers in essential industries who continue to work outside the home despite outbreaks in their communities, including some people who may need to continue working in these jobs because of their economic circumstances.  Nearly a quarter of employed Hispanic and Black or African American workers are employed in service industry jobs compared to 16% of non-Hispanic whites. Hispanic workers account for 17% of total employment but constitute 53% of agricultural workers; Black or African Americans make up 12% of all employed workers, but account for 30% of licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses.7   A lack of paid sick leave: Workers without paid sick leave might be more likely to continue to work even when they are sick for any reason. This can increase workers exposure to other workers who may have COVID-19, or, in turn, expose others them if they themselves have COVID-19. Hispanic workers have lower rates of access to paid leave than white non-Hispanic workers.8  Underlying health conditions and lower access to care Existing health disparities, such as poorer underlying health and barriers to getting health care, might make members of many racial and ethnic minority groups especially vulnerable in public health emergencies like outbreaks of COVID-19.  Not having health insurance: Compared to whites, Hispanics are almost 3 times as likely to be uninsured, and African Americans are almost twice as likely to be uninsured.9 In all age groups, blacks were more likely than whites to report not being able to see a doctor in the past year because of cost.10 Inadequate access is also driven by a long-standing distrust of the health care system, language barriers, and financial implications associated with missing work to receive care. S erious underlying medical conditions : Compared to whites, black Americans experience higher death rates, and higher prevalence rates of chronic conditions.10 Stigma and systemic inequalities may undermine prevention efforts, increase levels of chronic and toxic stress, and ultimately sustain health and health care disparities.

       " 'History shows that severe illness and death rates tend to be higher for racial and ethnic minority groups during public health emergencies.12 Addressing the needs of vulnerable populations in emergencies includes improving day-to-day life and harnessing the strengths of these groups. Shared faith, family, and cultural institutions are common sources of social support. These institutions can empower and encourage individuals and communities to take actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, care for those who become sick, and help community members cope with stress. For example, families, churches and other groups in affected populations can help their communities face an epidemic by consulting CDC guidance documents for their organization type. The federal government is undertaking the following:  Collecting data to monitor and track disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the number of COVID-19 cases, complications, and deaths to share broadly and inform decisions on how to effectively address observed disparities. These data will be translated into information to improve the clinical management of patients, allocation of resources, and targeted public health information. Supporting partnerships between scientific researchers, professional organizations, community organizations, and community members to address their need for information to prevent COVID-19 in racial and ethnic minority communities. Providing clinical guidance and guidance to support actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in schools, workplaces and community settings, including those serving racial and ethnic minorities.  Public health professionals can do the following:  Ensure that communications about COVID-19 and its impact on different population groups is frequent, clear, transparent, and credible. Work with other sectors , such as faith and community education, business, transportation, and housing organizations, to share information and implement strategies to address social and economic barriers to implementing steps to slow the spread of COVID-19. Link more people among racial and ethnic minority groups to healthcare services for serious underlying medical conditions — for example, services to help them obtain necessary medications, follow treatment plans, or get testing and treatment if they have COVID-19 symptoms. Provide information forhealthcare professionals and health systems to understand cultural differences among patients and how patients interact with providers and the healthcare system. The National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (The National CLAS Standards) aim to improve health care quality and advance health equity by establishing a framework for organizations to serve the nation’s increasingly diverse communities. Use evidence-based strategies to reduce health disparities. Those most vulnerable before an emergency are also the most vulnerable during and after an emergency.  Community organizations can do the following:  Prepare community health workers in underserved racial and ethnic minority communities to educate and link people to free or low-cost services. Prioritize resources for clinics, private practices, and other organizations that serve minority populations. Leverage effective health promotion programs in community, work, school, and home settings to disseminate recommendations and information about COVID-19.

Identify and address implicit bias that could hinder patient-provider interactions and communication.11   Provide medical interpretation services for patients who need them.  Work with communities and healthcare professional organizations to reduce cultural barriers to care. Connect patients with community resources that can help older adults and people with underlying conditions adhere to their care plans, including help getting extra supplies and medications they need and reminders for them to take their medicines.

Restrict access to reduce the number of workers in enclosed and confined areas at one time. Confined and enclosed areas (e.g., trailers, small rooms in buildings under construction) should be identified and access should be restricted to essential personnel only. Enclosed spaces (e.g., toilets, break areas) are potential transmission areas and should be treated accordingly. Time spent in these areas should be minimized. Rearrange administrative area workstations so that workers can stay at least 6 feet away from other workers. Install shields or barriers, such as plexiglass barriers, where possible. Remove or rearrange chairs and tables or add visual cue marks in break areas to support social distancing practices between workers. Identify alternative areas to accommodate overflow volume. Disinfect break or lunchroom areas between each group using the areas. Maintain social distancing when visiting lunch trucks or construction site vendors. Limit casual (social) conversations that normally occur at work. Cancel or postpone in-person meetings/trainings whenever possible.

CDC extended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other things, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent, detect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the health and safety of both passengers and crew. How long is the No Sail Order in effect? The extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:  The Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or The CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or 100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the Federal Register and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.  Why did CDC extend the No Sail Order? The No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers, cruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship passenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:  Prevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States Preserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19 Preserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources  What cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover? The No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial passenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an overnight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies to all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US jurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended operations. It does not apply to cargo ships. What does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip? Passengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line companies directly for further information. On March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health notice with a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread of COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board? We are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public has a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role to play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can practice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining them if they have been exposed to COVID-19. CDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard and as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise ships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed attestation stating that they have complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew members who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise ship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and transport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available here. Crew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions about the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their ship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or concerns with CDC by sending an email to eocevent431@cdc.gov. Cruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to sick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines should make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and other resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a plan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical care that the ship’s medical facility can’t provide. CDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are working with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to ensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if the ship can’t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical evacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical evacuations do not require CDC approval. What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board? A small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US waters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries. CDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health departments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help remaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible. These are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and therefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports of call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included. International cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been suspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC’s No Sail Order. Therefore, this chart is available for historical purposes but is no longer being updated.

       "  'Answer': 'Workplaces should clean surfaces at least daily. Special attention should be given to frequently touched surfaces (e.g. tabletops, door handles, light switches, desks, toilets, taps, TV remotes, kitchen surfaces and cupboard handles). Ideally, once clean, surfaces should also be disinfected regularly. Alternatively, you may be able to do a 2-in-1 clean and disinfection by using a combined detergent and disinfectant. Surfaces and fittings should be cleaned more frequently when:  visibly soiled used repeatedly by a number of people (e.g. trolleys, checkouts, EFTPOS machines), and after any spillage.  For routine cleaning, disinfectants are usually only necessary if a surface has been contaminated with potentially infectious material. For this reason, when and how often a workplace should undertake disinfection as part of routine cleaning will depend on the likelihood of contaminated material being present at the workplace. For example, in a busy retail environment with many customers and others entering a workplace each day, more frequent disinfection is recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. By contrast, for a small work crew operating the same item of plant each day with little interaction with other people, routine disinfection in addition to daily cleaning may not be reasonably practicable.',\n",

Disinfecting means using chemicals to kill germs on surfaces. It’s important to clean before disinfecting because organic matter and dirt can reduce the ability of disinfectants to kill germs. A combination of cleaning and disinfection will be most effective in removing the COVID-19 virus. Cleaning reduces the soil load on the surface, allowing the disinfectant to work and kill the COVID-19 virus.

       "  'Answer': 'Use the following steps to clean an environment:  Wear gloves when cleaning. Gloves should be discarded after each clean. If it is necessary to use reusable gloves, gloves should only be used for COVID-19 related cleaning and should not be used for other purposes or shared between workers. Wash reusable gloves with detergent and water after use and leave to dry. Clean hands immediately after removing gloves using soap and water or hand sanitiser. Thoroughly clean surfaces using detergent and water. Always clean from the cleanest surfaces to the dirtiest surfaces. This stops the transfer of germs to cleaner surfaces and allows you to physically remove and dispose of the largest possible amount of germs. If you need to use a disinfectant, clean the surface first using detergent then apply a disinfectant or use a combined detergent and disinfectant (see next section). A disinfectant will not kill germs if the surface has not been cleaned first. Apply disinfectant to surfaces using disposable paper towel or a disposable cloth. If non-disposable cloths are used, ensure they are laundered and dried before reusing. Allow the disinfectant to remain on the surface for the period of time required to kill the virus (contact time) as specified by the manufacturer. If no time is specified, leave for 10 minutes.

       "  'Answer': 'Workplaces should clean surfaces at least daily. Special attention should be given to frequently touched surfaces (e.g. tabletops, door handles, light switches, desks, toilets, taps, TV remotes, kitchen surfaces and cupboard handles). Ideally, once clean, surfaces should also be disinfected regularly. Alternatively, you may be able to do a 2-in-1 clean and disinfection by using a combined detergent and disinfectant. Surfaces and fittings should be cleaned more frequently when:  visibly soiled used repeatedly by a number of people (e.g. trolleys, checkouts, EFTPOS machines), and after any spillage.  For routine cleaning, disinfectants are usually only necessary if a surface has been contaminated with potentially infectious material. For this reason, when and how often a workplace should undertake disinfection as part of routine cleaning will depend on the likelihood of contaminated material being present at the workplace. For example, in a busy retail environment with many customers and others entering a workplace each day, more frequent disinfection is recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. By contrast, for a small work crew operating the same item of plant each day with little interaction with other people, routine disinfection in addition to daily cleaning may not be reasonably practicable.',\n",

For example, in a busy retail environment with many customers and others entering a workplace each day, more frequent disinfection is recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. By contrast, for a small work crew operating the same item of plant each day with little interaction with other people, routine disinfection in addition to daily cleaning may not be reasonably practicable.',\n",

       "  'Answer': 'Whether a child is ill or not, including where a child does not attend care as part of the family’s own precautionary measure against potential contact with COVID-19, Child Care Subsidy (CCS) can be paid for up to 62 absence days per child, for the 2019–20 financial year, without the need for families to provide documentation. Once a child’s 62 initial absences have been used, if more absences are required for COVID-19 related reasons, CCS can be paid for additional absences claimed without the need for medical evidence. Absences will not be counted during the Early Childhood Education and Care Relief Package period (commencing 6 April 2020) as session reports will not be submitted.',\n",

In some cases, consumers will have the right to receive a refund, rather than a credit note or voucher. For example, you may be entitled to a refund under the terms and conditions of your ticket. If you had a right to a refund under these terms and conditions at the time you purchased your ticket, businesses are not permitted to change the terms at a later time to deny you a refund. Similarly, if you were previously told by a business that you would receive a refund for your cancelled travel, the business is not permitted to later deny you the promised refund. Depending on your circumstances, you may also have other rights under common law, contract or state legislation. Travel cancellations due to government restrictions do impact your rights under the consumer guarantee provisions of the Australian Consumer Law. However, you may have other remedies, including potential rights to a refund, outside of the consumer guarantees, as explained above. You should check your terms and conditions, and any previous communications with the business, and contact the business directly to request a remedy. This may be a refund or credit note or voucher, depending on your circumstances. If you receive a credit note or voucher, it should have an expiration date which is long enough to allow you to use the credit note or voucher. State and territory consumer protection agencies may be able to assist with guidance or conciliation involving relevant state legislation.

       "  'Answer': \"On 14 May 2020, the Government announced that mutual obligation requirements will continue to be suspended until 1 June 2020 as a result of the impact of COVID-19. This extends the exemptions which were due to end on 22 May, as announced on 22 April 2020. This means that during this period no compliance action will be taken for job seekers who do not report their attendance at appointments or activities, which means no one's payments will be suspended. The Government will continue to review these arrangements regularly. Please visit the Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business's webpage for further Ministerial announcements. The Government also announced a number of changes to mutual obligation requirements to reduce or eliminate the need for face-to-face contact, when requested by a job seeker or job service provider. The changes include:  Job seekers will have the option to request that face to face meetings with their job service providers take place over the phone or via an online channel such as Skype; Job seekers will be able to complete activities such as online training, creating job plans, writing a CV and preparing job applications online; Job Plans will be adjusted to a default requirement of four job searches a month (or fewer, at provider discretion) to reflect the softening labour market conditions. Work for the Dole and other activities delivered in group settings that cannot be delivered online will be suspended until further notice; Jobs Fairs and other large events will be postponed; and Job service providers will be required to perform new risk assessments for a range of activities like Youth Jobs PaTH internships.  Current income support recipients who cannot meet mutual obligation requirements due to isolation should call Services Australia and can be granted a Major Personal Crisis exemption, without having to provide evidence such as a medical certificate. Students receiving Youth Allowance (student) or other study related payments who are in Australia but unable to attend studies due to coronavirus would be taken to have a reasonable excuse for not meeting study activity requirements for their payments.

Other situations where Working Holiday Makers have permission from the Department to work for the same employer for longer than six months, include where the work is:  in different locations and work in any one location does not exceed six months in plant and animal cultivation anywhere in Australia in certain industries in northern Australia only assisting bushfire recovery efforts.  In any other circumstance, you need to request permission to work with the same employer for longer than 6 months.',\n",

       "  'Answer': 'The criteria for having a test for COVID-19 are updated regularly as new evidence becomes available. Testing diagnoses patients with COVID-19 and also helps health authorities monitor and track the spread of COVID-19. People with mild symptoms can still spread the virus. To help stop the resurgence and spread of COVID-19, anyone with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection should get tested. The symptoms include:  fever respiratory symptoms  coughing sore throat shortness of breath    If you have one or more of these symptoms, even mildly, it is important you get tested as soon as possible. Early diagnosis means you can take steps to avoid spreading the virus to someone else. If you have other symptoms that may occur with COVID-19 you should seek advice from your doctor or from healthdirect about whether you should get tested. As the situation changes, states and territories may adjust their testing criteria based on local needs. For latest information check your state or territory health website. Testing is even more important if you have symptoms and any of the following apply to you:  you have returned from overseas in the past 14 days you travelled on a cruise ship (either passenger or crew) in the 14 days before developing symptoms you have been in close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 14 days you are a health care, aged care or residential care worker or staff member with direct patient contact you have lived in or travelled through an area where there is a higher risk of community transmission, as defined by the local public health unit  People in high-risk settings will be regularly monitored to ensure symptoms are identified early. Rapid response plans will be activated if someone in those settings develops a fever or respiratory symptoms. People who have recovered from COVID-19 need to be tested before they can go into high risk settings. High-risk settings include:  aged and residential care facilities detention centres or correctional facilities boarding schools military group residences and other closed settings, such as Navy ships or live-in accommodation rural and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities  Where to get tested You can:  contact your doctor and they will arrange the test attend a respiratory or fever clinic  Respiratory or fever clinics are dedicated health centres around the country focusing on testing people with acute respiratory infection symptoms Find the respiratory/fever clinic nearest to you. Your state or territory may have extra clinics where you can get tested. You can find them through your state or territory health website. If your symptoms are serious, you should seek urgent medical attention. If possible, call ahead so the medical facility can prepare. If it is a medical emergency, please call 000. The Department of Health regularly reviews these criteria. After testing It may take a day or two for your test results to come back. If you have serious symptoms you will be kept in hospital and isolated from other patients to prevent the virus spreading. If your doctor says you are well enough to go home while you wait for your test results, you should:  isolate at home protect yourself and others  For questions about testing or patient welfare, call the National Coronavirus Helpline.

People who have recovered from COVID-19 need to be tested before they can go into high risk settings. High-risk settings include:  aged and residential care facilities detention centres or correctional facilities boarding schools military group residences and other closed settings, such as Navy ships or live-in accommodation rural and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities  Where to get tested You can:  contact your doctor and they will arrange the test attend a respiratory or fever clinic  Respiratory or fever clinics are dedicated health centres around the country focusing on testing people with acute respiratory infection symptoms Find the respiratory/fever clinic nearest to you.

       "  'Answer': ' If your event is cancelled the ACCC expects that you will receive a refund or other remedy, such as a credit note or voucher, in most circumstances. If the event is cancelled due to government restrictions, this impacts your rights under the consumer guarantees. However, you may also have other remedies outside of the Australian Consumer Law. For example, you may be entitled to a refund under the terms and conditions of your ticket. If you had a right to a refund under these terms and conditions at the time you purchased your ticket, businesses are not permitted to change the terms at a later time to deny you a refund. Depending on your circumstances, you may also have other rights under common law, contract or state legislation. You should contact the business directly to request a refund or other remedy such as a credit note or voucher. If you receive a credit note or voucher, it should have an expiration date which is long enough to allow you to use the credit note or voucher. State and territory consumer protection agencies may be able to assist with guidance or conciliation involving relevant state legislation. Consumers may also wish to seek independent legal advice about whether they may have a remedy under common law, contract or state legislation. Given the exceptional circumstances, the ACCC encourages all businesses to treat consumers fairly. ',\n",

       "  'Answer': 'The Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme will provide small and medium sized business with timely access to working capital to help them get through the impact of the Coronavirus. The Government will provide eligible lenders with a guarantee for loans with the following terms:  SMEs, including sole traders, with a turnover of up to $50 million. Maximum total size of loans of $250,000 per borrower. Loans will be up to three years, with an initial six month repayment holiday. Unsecured finance, meaning that borrowers will not have to provide an asset as security for the loan.  The decision on whether to extend credit, and management of the loan, will remain with the lender. However, the Government expects that lenders will look through the cycle to sensibly take into account the uncertainty of the current economic conditions when determining whether credit should be extended. As part of the loan products available, the Government will encourage lenders to provide facilities to SMEs that only have to be drawn if needed by the SME. This will mean that the SME would only incur interest on the amount they draw down. If they do not draw down any funds from the facility, no interest will be charged, but they will retain the flexibility to draw down funds should the need arise. SMEs interested in the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme should approach their financial institution for more information. The Government is working with banks and other eligible lenders to ensure loans are available as soon as possible. While the scheme officially commences from April 2020, your bank or other lenders may be able to provide credit sooner, and still benefit from the guarantee. The Treasurer has varied the authorisation conditions for the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) scheme to limit the matters that AFCA can consider in relation to certain decisions made by lenders under the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme. Under the AFCA Scheme Authorisation (Additional Condition) Amendment 2020, the AFCA Scheme Rules will be amended to limit AFCA’s ability to consider decisions made by the lender about whether to provide a loan (and the amount of the loan) under the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme and ensure that when making assessments or determinations about a complaint, AFCA gives consideration to the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and the intent and requirements of the Scheme. The amendments to AFCA’s authorisation conditions also apply to decisions made by lenders (all lenders and not only those lenders that are participating lenders under the Scheme) to approve repayment deferrals for businesses in response to the coronavirus crisis. The amendments exclude from AFCA’s remit complaints in relation to decisions by lenders to offer repayment deferrals to businesses impacted by the coronavirus, and any consequential change to the amounts payable under the loan or the duration of the loan. AFCA will amend its Scheme Rules to give effect to this change and provide further guidance for businesses and lenders. The changes to the rules will apply for complaints made after 25 April 2020.

The law aims to strike a balance between the right to communicate freely (‘freedom of speech’) and the right to live free from racial hatred.

       "  'Answer': \" Many travel service providers have short-term COVID-19 policies allowing for credits or refunds which do not apply to bookings after a certain date, as the travel service provider does not yet have certainty as to whether future travel will be cancelled. In many cases, these dates have subsequently been extended as travel restrictions remain in place, and travel service providers cancel further services. If you cancel your booking before your travel service is cancelled, this could be classified as a 'change of mind' cancellation and this could limit your ability to obtain a refund or a credit. If you are concerned about this, the ACCC recommends that you contact the business you made your booking with to ask:  how far out from your travel date will the business confirm the cancellation of your travel, if it is to be cancelled how its cancellation policy will apply if travel restrictions are still in place at the date of your booking and your travel is cancelled what remedies may be available to you if you cancel now as compared to what remedies may be available to you if you wait until the service provider cancels.   Depending on your circumstances, it may be in your interests to wait for further updates from your travel service provider before taking any steps to cancel your travel and seek a remedy. \",\n",

The law aims to strike a balance between the right to communicate freely (‘freedom of speech’) and the right to live free from racial hatred. In some circumstances actions may not be against the law if they are “done reasonably and in good faith”.

Travellers arriving from any country may undergo enhanced health screening on arrival in Australia. All arrivals will be quarantined for 14 days and state and territory travel restrictions may also apply. The Information for international travellers fact sheet is provided to travellers on arrival in Australia and provides further information on current requirements. Learn more about who can enter Australia from the Department of Home Affairs. Australian Border Force liaison officers at overseas airports will work with airlines to identify anyone who should not board a flight to Australia. Restrictions on international travel remain for now. National Cabinet has agreed to a 3-step plan to create a COVIDSafe society. Under Step 3, interstate travel and the possibility of travel to New Zealand will be considered.',\n",
