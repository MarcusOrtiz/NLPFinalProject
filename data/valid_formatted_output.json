Detailed information on how to save energy is available for households and businesses. Heating and cooling  Around 40% of home energy use can go on heating and cooling. Close off rooms not in use. Set your heating between 18\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and your cooling between 25\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C. For every degree you increase heating and cooling, you increase energy use between 5% and 10%. Dress comfortably. You may need to look professional from the waist up for virtual meetings, but working from home means you can dress for the season.  Computers  Set your monitor to switch off\/sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity. Reduce screen brightness to the lowest, visibly comfortable setting. Switch off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when you\u2019re not using them as they use a substantial amount of power by constantly searching for a signal. Close any applications you\u2019re not using.

From 27 April 2020 the taper rate for the partner income test associated with JobSeeker Payment will change from 60c to 25c. This change is temporary and will operate until the Coronavirus Supplement ceases to be payable.

{"Question":"What is the governments approach to drawdown rates?","Answer":"National Cabinet\u2019s 3-step plan provides a pathway for states and territories to move toward COVIDSafe communities in a way that suits their circumstances. States and territories will move between the steps on the pathway at different times, in line with their public health situation and local conditions. They\u2019ll need to maintain strong and prompt control of any outbreaks. The plan gives Australians some certainty about what is to come in the months ahead. In conjunction with advice released by Safe Work Australia, it will help our businesses make decisions about how they can operate in a COVIDSafe way to protect their customers and workers. For each of the major areas of restrictions we have set out 3 key steps between where we are now and where we want to be.  The first steps are cautious ones. It is important we do not move too quickly and risk losing the control we have achieved. Some businesses will start to reopen as we start to allow groups of up to 10 people to be together in homes and in the community. These steps help build our COVIDSafe economy, and also give us more opportunities to connect with family and friends. The second steps in each area will build on this through larger gatherings and even more businesses reopening. As businesses take steps to ensure they are COVIDSafe, we should all feel safe and confident doing some of the things we\u2019ve missed over the last few months. Some higher-risk settings and activities will still be tightly restricted. The third steps are where we start to fully embrace long-term COVIDSafe ways of living and working \u2014 the arrangements that will be our \u2018new normal\u2019 while the virus remains a threat.

If it is necessary to use reusable gloves, gloves should only be used for COVID-19 related cleaning and should not be used for other purposes or shared between workers. Wash reusable gloves with detergent and water after use and leave to dry. Clean hands immediately after removing gloves using soap and water or hand sanitiser. Thoroughly clean surfaces using detergent and water. Always clean from the cleanest surfaces to the dirtiest surfaces. This stops the transfer of germs to cleaner surfaces and allows you to physically remove and dispose of the largest possible amount of germs. If you need to use a disinfectant, clean the surface first using detergent then apply a disinfectant or use a combined detergent and disinfectant (see next section). A disinfectant will not kill germs if the surface has not been cleaned first. Apply disinfectant to surfaces using disposable paper towel or a disposable cloth. If non-disposable cloths are used, ensure they are laundered and dried before reusing. Allow the disinfectant to remain on the surface for the period of time required to kill the virus (contact time) as specified by the manufacturer. If no time is specified, leave for 10 minutes.

{"Question":"What are my rights as a customer if I have a gift card or purchased something from a business that closed due to COVID-19?","Answer":" If a business has possession of your item for repair or alteration, you should first check the terms and conditions of your contract with the service provider to see when you are entitled to get the item back. You may also have rights under the Australian Consumer Law. The consumer guarantees provide that services such as repairs and alterations must be delivered in a reasonable time when there is no agreed end date. If the service has not yet been provided by the business and is unlikely to be delivered in a reasonable time, you may be entitled to cancel the contract, have any money already paid refunded to you, and the item returned \u2014 although this position will be different if the business is prevented from supplying services as a direct result of Government restrictions. If the service has been already been provided by the business, you may be required to complete payment of any unpaid amounts before being entitled to get the item back. The ACCC expects that, given the exceptional circumstances, once you have fully paid for the service, the business should make reasonable endeavours to return your item to you, even if its physical stores are temporarily closed. This could include providing a way for you to collect the item in person, or delivering the item to you where appropriate. You should contact the business directly to discuss options for the return of your item. Depending on your circumstances, you may also have rights under common law, contract or state bailment legislation.

Services are only eligible for IDF for the hours of actual attendance and the approved number of non face-to-face hours as set out in their funding letter, per Section 11.1.1 of the Inclusion Support Program Guidelines. If services receive an error when claiming they should contact the IDF Manager at idfm@ku.com.au.

{"Question":"I booked my wedding recently but it has been cancelled due to covid and now my insurance company is not helping me out, what should I do?","Answer":" If your wedding is cancelled due to government restrictions, this impacts your rights under the consumer guarantees. However, you may also have other remedies outside of the Australian Consumer Law. For example, you may be entitled to a refund of your deposit under the terms and conditions of your booking. You should contact the venue directly to request a refund or other remedy, such as a credit note to postpone your wedding to a later date. If you had a right to a refund under the terms and conditions at the time you made your booking, businesses are not permitted to change the terms at a later time to deny you a refund. If you receive a credit note or voucher, it should have an expiration date which is long enough to allow you to use the credit note or voucher. Depending on your circumstances, you may also have other rights under common law, contract or state legislation. For example, you may have rights under contract law where the contract can no longer be performed. State and territory consumer protection agencies may be able to assist with guidance or conciliation involving relevant state legislation. Consumers may also wish to seek independent legal advice about whether they may have a remedy under common law, contract or state legislation. The ACCC encourages all businesses to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances. ","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":3.3333333333}

{"Question":"What requirements need to be met in order to remove coronavirus restrictions?","Answer":"National Cabinet will regularly review our progress. They will be closely monitoring the situation as restrictions are eased to assess the impact of the changes so we can move forward safely and with confidence. As set out in the Pandemic Health Intelligence Plan endorsed by National Cabinet on 1 May 2020, they will consider:  the pattern of disease around Australia the capacity of our public health surveillance and testing approaches to detect and isolate cases the readiness of our health system to respond to outbreaks while also meeting people\u2019s ongoing health needs, and how well people are following the health advice and abiding by the restrictions in place  This information will guide decisions on the steps each jurisdiction takes as we make Australia COVIDSafe. Australia is prepared for an increase in case numbers or possible outbreaks. It may be that in some parts of the country we sometimes have to take a step back in order to contain a local outbreak. This should be the exception rather than the norm.

{"Question":"What requirements need to be met in order to remove coronavirus restrictions?","Answer":"National Cabinet will regularly review our progress. They will be closely monitoring the situation as restrictions are eased to assess the impact of the changes so we can move forward safely and with confidence. As set out in the Pandemic Health Intelligence Plan endorsed by National Cabinet on 1 May 2020, they will consider:  the pattern of disease around Australia the capacity of our public health surveillance and testing approaches to detect and isolate cases the readiness of our health system to respond to outbreaks while also meeting people\u2019s ongoing health needs, and how well people are following the health advice and abiding by the restrictions in place  This information will guide decisions on the steps each jurisdiction takes as we make Australia COVIDSafe. Australia is prepared for an increase in case numbers or possible outbreaks. It may be that in some parts of the country we sometimes have to take a step back in order to contain a local outbreak. This should be the exception rather than the norm.

{"Question":"What requirements need to be met in order to remove coronavirus restrictions?","Answer":"National Cabinet\u2019s 3-step plan provides a pathway for states and territories to move toward COVIDSafe communities in a way that suits their circumstances. States and territories will move between the steps on the pathway at different times, in line with their public health situation and local conditions. They\u2019ll need to maintain strong and prompt control of any outbreaks. The plan gives Australians some certainty about what is to come in the months ahead. In conjunction with advice released by Safe Work Australia, it will help our businesses make decisions about how they can operate in a COVIDSafe way to protect their customers and workers. For each of the major areas of restrictions we have set out 3 key steps between where we are now and where we want to be.  The first steps are cautious ones. It is important we do not move too quickly and risk losing the control we have achieved. Some businesses will start to reopen as we start to allow groups of up to 10 people to be together in homes and in the community. These steps help build our COVIDSafe economy, and also give us more opportunities to connect with family and friends. The second steps in each area will build on this through larger gatherings and even more businesses reopening. As businesses take steps to ensure they are COVIDSafe, we should all feel safe and confident doing some of the things we\u2019ve missed over the last few months. Some higher-risk settings and activities will still be tightly restricted. The third steps are where we start to fully embrace long-term COVIDSafe ways of living and working \u2014 the arrangements that will be our \u2018new normal\u2019 while the virus remains a threat. Restrictions will be minimised. Gatherings of up to 100 people, interstate travel, growth in community sport, and the possibility of travel to New Zealand, will be underpinned by COVIDSafe practices. With everyone playing their role, we will build a COVIDSafe Australia, where lives and livelihoods are protected. It is likely some restrictions, on things like international travel and mass gatherings, will remain necessary.

{"Question":"There any temporary exemptions from mutual obligations","Answer":"On 14 May 2020, the Government announced that mutual obligation requirements will continue to be suspended until 1 June 2020 as a result of the impact of COVID-19. This extends the exemptions which were due to end on 22 May, as announced on 22 April 2020. This means that during this period no compliance action will be taken for job seekers who do not report their attendance at appointments or activities, which means no one's payments will be suspended. The Government will continue to review these arrangements regularly. Please visit the Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business's webpage for further Ministerial announcements. The Government also announced a number of changes to mutual obligation requirements to reduce or eliminate the need for face-to-face contact, when requested by a job seeker or job service provider. The changes include:  Job seekers will have the option to request that face to face meetings with their job service providers take place over the phone or via an online channel such as Skype; Job seekers will be able to complete activities such as online training, creating job plans, writing a CV and preparing job applications online; Job Plans will be adjusted to a default requirement of four job searches a month (or fewer, at provider discretion) to reflect the softening labour market conditions. Work for the Dole and other activities delivered in group settings that cannot be delivered online will be suspended until further notice; Jobs Fairs and other large events will be postponed; and Job service providers will be required to perform new risk assessments for a range of activities like Youth Jobs PaTH internships.  Current income support recipients who cannot meet mutual obligation requirements due to isolation should call Services Australia and can be granted a Major Personal Crisis exemption, without having to provide evidence such as a medical certificate. Students receiving Youth Allowance (student) or other study related payments who are in Australia but unable to attend studies due to coronavirus would be taken to have a reasonable excuse for not meeting study activity requirements for their payments.

In some cases, consumers will have the right to receive a refund, rather than a credit note or voucher. For example, you may be entitled to a refund under the terms and conditions of your ticket. If you had a right to a refund under these terms and conditions at the time you purchased your ticket, businesses are not permitted to change the terms at a later time to deny you a refund. Similarly, if you were previously told by a business that you would receive a refund for your cancelled travel, the business is not permitted to later deny you the promised refund. Depending on your circumstances, you may also have other rights under common law, contract or state legislation. Travel cancellations due to government restrictions do impact your rights under the consumer guarantee provisions of the Australian Consumer Law. However, you may have other remedies, including potential rights to a refund, outside of the consumer guarantees, as explained above. You should check your terms and conditions, and any previous communications with the business, and contact the business directly to request a remedy. This may be a refund or credit note or voucher, depending on your circumstances. If you receive a credit note or voucher, it should have an expiration date which is long enough to allow you to use the credit note or voucher. State and territory consumer protection agencies may be able to assist with guidance or conciliation involving relevant state legislation.

{"Question":"If I am receiving aid from the Early Childhood Education and Care Relief Package, am I allowed to change my service offer or add administrative fees?","Answer":"The intent of the weekly payments is to enable access to free child care for families of the priority groups like essential workers, during the COVID-19 crisis. The weekly payments should be the full amount a provider\/service will receive, unless they apply for and meet the criteria for an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment. Also noting that the Relief Package is complementary to other Government business support payments, like the JobKeeper Payment a provider may receive. While providers\/services receive payments under the Relief Package, they should not be changing their service offer and\/or increasing or adding new administrative fees. A provider\u2019s usual service offering generally includes consumable items such as meals, wipes, or art supplies as part of the cost of providing a session of care. For example, if nappies were included as part of the session fee your service usually provided, nappies should continue to be provided without any extra cost to families. Some services also charge administrative fees. These fees do not form part of the session of care fee that a family\u2019s Child Care Subsidy was calculated on, meaning that services can continue to charge administrative fees, for example, late pick-up fees. However, services are not to increase these fees for the duration of the Relief Package or add new ones that were not listed in a family\u2019s Complying Written Agreement. A condition of a provider\/service receiving payments under the Relief Package is that all services continue to meet the provider obligations under Family Assistance Law and there are to be no fees charged for care provided. The department can take compliance action against services not meeting the conditions of the payments.

The ACCC encourages state and national bodies, and clubs and associations, to treat consumers fairly in these circumstances and to consider appropriate mechanisms to provide refunds or other remedies such as credit notes or vouchers to consumers.

{"Question":"If my wedding has been cancelled or downsized due to the COVID-19 pandemic, am I entitled to refunds on deposits I've paid for products and services I now no longer need?","Answer":" If a supplier has accepted payment for your wedding dress, they must supply it to you by the date they have indicated or, if no time was specified, within a reasonable timeframe. You should first contact your supplier to ask whether the dress is still able to be delivered and, if so, when you can expect to receive it. If the business advises that your dress can no longer be supplied, then the ACCC expects you will receive a refund or other remedy such as a credit note or voucher. The ACCC understands that many businesses are struggling to manage supply delays at this point in time due to circumstances outside their control. We urge consumers to remain patient and anticipate that it may take longer than usual for goods to be supplied. ","Rating":"Could be Improved","Score":2,"Average":2.1666666667}

{"Question":"If my wedding has been cancelled or downsized due to the COVID-19 pandemic, am I entitled to refunds on deposits I've paid for products and services I now no longer need?","Answer":" If your wedding is cancelled due to government restrictions, this impacts your rights under the consumer guarantees. However, you may also have other remedies outside of the Australian Consumer Law. For example, you may be entitled to a refund of your deposit under the terms and conditions of your booking. You should contact the venue directly to request a refund or other remedy, such as a credit note to postpone your wedding to a later date. If you had a right to a refund under the terms and conditions at the time you made your booking, businesses are not permitted to change the terms at a later time to deny you a refund. If you receive a credit note or voucher, it should have an expiration date which is long enough to allow you to use the credit note or voucher. Depending on your circumstances, you may also have other rights under common law, contract or state legislation. For example, you may have rights under contract law where the contract can no longer be performed. State and territory consumer protection agencies may be able to assist with guidance or conciliation involving relevant state legislation. Consumers may also wish to seek independent legal advice about whether they may have a remedy under common law, contract or state legislation. The ACCC encourages all businesses to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances. ","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":3.3333333333}

{"Question":"Guidelines are in place for cleaning terminals","Answer":"Use the following steps to clean an environment:  Wear gloves when cleaning. Gloves should be discarded after each clean. If it is necessary to use reusable gloves, gloves should only be used for COVID-19 related cleaning and should not be used for other purposes or shared between workers. Wash reusable gloves with detergent and water after use and leave to dry. Clean hands immediately after removing gloves using soap and water or hand sanitiser. Thoroughly clean surfaces using detergent and water. Always clean from the cleanest surfaces to the dirtiest surfaces. This stops the transfer of germs to cleaner surfaces and allows you to physically remove and dispose of the largest possible amount of germs. If you need to use a disinfectant, clean the surface first using detergent then apply a disinfectant or use a combined detergent and disinfectant (see next section). A disinfectant will not kill germs if the surface has not been cleaned first. Apply disinfectant to surfaces using disposable paper towel or a disposable cloth. If non-disposable cloths are used, ensure they are laundered and dried before reusing. Allow the disinfectant to remain on the surface for the period of time required to kill the virus (contact time) as specified by the manufacturer. If no time is specified, leave for 10 minutes.

However, there is a strain on all testing related supplies due to global demand far exceeding supply and production capacity. Staff can be assured that we have personal protective equipment coming in all the time, which means, in turn, that patients can get the best possible care. For instance, the National Medical Stockpile has more than 10 million masks. The Australian Government continues to work to secure additional masks to ensure the National Medical Stockpile remains well stocked, and Australia has enough personal protective equipment to support our medical professionals as the pandemic unfolds. This includes boosting domestic manufacturing capability and capacity. There are usually 2,200 ventilated hospital beds in Australia. By repurposing anaesthetic machines and other equipment over the past six weeks, we now have 4,400 ventilated beds, and we're looking to make that 7,500. At the start of April, the number of patients with coronavirus in intensive care units and needing ventilators was 20. The Communicable Diseases Network Australia is meeting daily to reassess its guidance on testing requirements, so that only essential testing is being undertaken.","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":1.0}

{"Question":"How should a temperature check be administered?","Answer":"The criteria for having a test for COVID-19 are updated regularly as new evidence becomes available. Testing diagnoses patients with COVID-19 and also helps health authorities monitor and track the spread of COVID-19. People with mild symptoms can still spread the virus. To help stop the resurgence and spread of COVID-19, anyone with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection should get tested. The symptoms include:  fever respiratory symptoms  coughing sore throat shortness of breath    If you have one or more of these symptoms, even mildly, it is important you get tested as soon as possible. Early diagnosis means you can take steps to avoid spreading the virus to someone else. If you have other symptoms that may occur with COVID-19 you should seek advice from your doctor or from healthdirect about whether you should get tested. As the situation changes, states and territories may adjust their testing criteria based on local needs. For latest information check your state or territory health website. Testing is even more important if you have symptoms and any of the following apply to you:  you have returned from overseas in the past 14 days you travelled on a cruise ship (either passenger or crew) in the 14 days before developing symptoms you have been in close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 14 days you are a health care, aged care or residential care worker or staff member with direct patient contact you have lived in or travelled through an area where there is a higher risk of community transmission, as defined by the local public health unit  People in high-risk settings will be regularly monitored to ensure symptoms are identified early. Rapid response plans will be activated if someone in those settings develops a fever or respiratory symptoms. People who have recovered from COVID-19 need to be tested before they can go into high risk settings. High-risk settings include:  aged and residential care facilities detention centres or correctional facilities boarding schools military group residences and other closed settings, such as Navy ships or live-in accommodation rural and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities  Where to get tested You can:  contact your doctor and they will arrange the test attend a respiratory or fever clinic  Respiratory or fever clinics are dedicated health centres around the country focusing on testing people with acute respiratory infection symptoms Find the respiratory\/fever clinic nearest to you. Your state or territory may have extra clinics where you can get tested. You can find them through your state or territory health website. If your symptoms are serious, you should seek urgent medical attention. If possible, call ahead so the medical facility can prepare. If it is a medical emergency, please call 000. The Department of Health regularly reviews these criteria. After testing It may take a day or two for your test results to come back. If you have serious symptoms you will be kept in hospital and isolated from other patients to prevent the virus spreading.

{"Question":"How should an OB\/GYN setting handle a shortage of respirators?","Answer":"During respirator shortages, care should be taken to ensure that N95 respirators are reserved for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In such shortage situations, facemasks might be used for other types of patient care. Alternatives to N95 respirators might be considered where feasible. These include other classes of NIOSH-approved filtering facepiece respirators, half facepiece or full facepiece elastomeric respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) where feasible. All of these alternatives will provide equivalent or higher protection than N95 respirators when properly worn. However, PAPRs and elastomeric respirators should not be used in surgical settings due to concerns that exhaled air may contaminate the sterile field. For more information please see: Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 Respirators: Conventional Capacity Strategies. When respirator supplies are restored, the facility can switch back to use of N95 respirators for all care of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.

{"Question":"WHat is anitbody testing for COVID19?","Answer":"Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests. If you test positive  A positive test result shows you have antibodies that likely resulted from an infection with SARS-CoV-2, or possibly a related coronavirus. It\u2019s unclear if those antibodies can provide protection (immunity) against getting infected again. This means that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to the virus. If you have no symptoms, you likely do not have an active infection and no additional follow-up is needed. If you have symptoms and meet other guidelines for testing, you would need another type of test called a nucleic acid test, or viral test.

It\u2019s possible you could still get sick if you have been exposed to the virus recently, since antibodies don\u2019t show up for 1 to 3 weeks after infection.

Wash your hands after handling animals, their food, waste, or supplies. Practice good pet hygiene and clean up after pets properly. Talk to your veterinarian if you have questions about your pet\u2019s health. Be aware that children 5 years of age and younger, people with weakened immune systems, and people 65 years of age and older are more likely to get sick from germs some animals can carry.

{"Question":"How can I keep my employees safe while we work at a large construction site?","Answer":"Employers should have a COVID-19 response plan to protect workers, following CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers, and share this plan with you and your coworkers in languages you all understand. Small construction businesses should review the CDC small business guidelines. Your employer should take steps to: Reduce transmission among workers:  Take steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if an employee is sick.  Actively encourage sick employees to stay home. Sick employees diagnosed with COVID-19 shouldn\u2019t return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.   Provide employees with accurate information (in a language they understand) about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure.  Provide workers with basic facts. Conduct toolbox talks on all job sites to explain the protective measures in place.   Be aware that some employees may be at higher risk for severe illness, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. Implement specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact for these employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other workers, customers, and visitors, or to telework if possible. Provide training to employees on proper handwashing practices and other routine preventative measures. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19. Provide employees with access to soap, clean running water, and materials for drying their hands, or if soap and water are not readily available provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol at stations around the establishment for use by both workers and customers.  Place handwashing stations and\/or hand sanitizers in multiple locations (including in or adjacent to portable restrooms) to encourage hand hygiene.   Explore alternative ways to promote hand hygiene if there is difficulty sourcing hand sanitizer and running water is not available on site. Some examples may include:  Install temporary or mobile handwashing stations, making sure there is an adequate supply of water, soap, and single-use paper towels. Provide a large (5+ gallon) bucket with a lid and tap that can be used to provide water for handwashing. If this method is used, the water tap should be regularly cleaned and disinfected, and the contaminated wastewater must be collected and treated in accordance with local laws and environmental regulations. Provide fresh clean water daily. Depending on the size or configuration of the job site, there may need to be multiple handwashing stations available to accommodate the workforce while maintaining social distancing, and stations may need to be restocked during the course of the day to maintain adequate handwashing supplies.   Develop and implement social distancing guidance for the workplace to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between workers when possible.  Maintain a healthy work environment  Institute measures to physically separate and increase distance between employees, such as the following:  Modify work schedules to stagger work, provide alternating workdays or extra shifts to reduce the total number of workers on a job site at any given time. Restrict access to reduce the number of workers in enclosed and confined areas at one time. Confined and enclosed areas (e.g., trailers, small rooms in buildings under construction) should be identified and access should be restricted to essential personnel only. Enclosed spaces (e.g., toilets, break areas) are potential transmission areas and should be treated accordingly. Time spent in these areas should be minimized. Rearrange administrative area workstations so that workers can stay at least 6 feet away from other workers. Install shields or barriers, such as plexiglass barriers, where possible. Remove or rearrange chairs and tables or add visual cue marks in break areas to support social distancing practices between workers. Identify alternative areas to accommodate overflow volume. Disinfect break or lunchroom areas between each group using the areas. Maintain social distancing when visiting lunch trucks or construction site vendors. Limit casual (social) conversations that normally occur at work. Cancel or postpone in-person meetings\/trainings whenever possible. If you must meet, spread out to a distance of 6 feet or more between attendees. Reduce the number of individuals at meetings, including worker orientations, to increase the distance between individuals.   Conduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, for which workers may need personal protective equipment (PPE).

Employers are required to determine, select, provide, and train on correct PPE use and application for their workers\u2019 specific job duties (see 29 CFR 1926 Subpart Eexternal icon).   Place posters that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and proper hand hygiene practices at the entrance to the workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen. Provide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for employees to use. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. If the surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them prior to disinfecting. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions that are prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and that are appropriate for the surface.

Provide disposable disinfectant wipes (when available) so that surfaces commonly touched can be wiped down. Follow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.  Maintain healthy business operations  Designate a safety and health officer to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns at every jobsite. Workers should know who this person is and how to contact them. Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider\u2019s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work. Provide information on whom to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

{"Question":"How can I actively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect myself?","Answer":"Know how it spreads  There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.  Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.    Wash your hands often  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact  Avoid close contact with people who are sick, even inside your home. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members. Put distance between yourself and other people outside of your home.  Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from other people. Do not gather in groups.

{"Question":"How safe is it to go on a cruise during the COVID-19 outbreak?","Answer":"Outbreaks of infectious diseases can happen on cruise ships because people spend time close together and with travelers from many countries. Disease can spread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer to other ships. Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between countries. For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across the globe. Because of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk of COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order for cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US travelers to defer all cruise travel. The No Sail Order is published in the Federal Register. CDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also protecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into communities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive efforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and update our recommendations as the situation evolves. What is the No Sail Order? In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of spread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide No Sail Order on March 14 to prevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC extended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other things, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent, detect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the health and safety of both passengers and crew. How long is the No Sail Order in effect? The extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:  The Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or The CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or 100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the Federal Register and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.  Why did CDC extend the No Sail Order? The No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers, cruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship passenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:  Prevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States Preserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19 Preserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources  What cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover? The No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial passenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an overnight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies to all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US jurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended operations. It does not apply to cargo ships. What does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip? Passengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line companies directly for further information. On March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health notice with a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread of COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board? We are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public has a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role to play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can practice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining them if they have been exposed to COVID-19. CDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard and as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise ships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed attestation stating that they have complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew members who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise ship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and transport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available here. Crew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions about the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their ship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or concerns with CDC by sending an email to eocevent431@cdc.gov. Cruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to sick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines should make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and other resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a plan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical care that the ship\u2019s medical facility can\u2019t provide. CDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are working with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to ensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if the ship can\u2019t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical evacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical evacuations do not require CDC approval. What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board? A small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US waters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries. CDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health departments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help remaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible. These are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and therefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports of call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included. International cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been suspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC\u2019s No Sail Order.

{"Question":"What are the recommendations for cops who have come in contact with someone suspected to have COVID19?","Answer":"If law enforcement personnel have direct personal contact with an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, they should immediately use alcohol- based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol, or wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. They should also avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth. Any uniform items (or other surfaces) that were potentially exposed should be disinfected or cleaned as soon as feasible. For example, the duty belt or other non-porous items can be disinfected using products that are EPA-approved for use against the virusexternal icon. Porous items, like the uniform, should be replaced as soon as possible and then laundered according to manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. This is especially important if any body fluids were expelled during the encounter (bloodborne pathogen protocols should also be followed if applicable). Gloves should be worn when touching potentially contaminated items or applying disinfectants and it is important to perform hand hygiene upon removing gloves or other PPE. Law enforcement personnel who have an exposure should be evaluated by their occupational health program and may be able to finish their work shift before starting home isolation. If personnel and resources are available, it is most protective for law enforcement personnel to stay at home until 14 days after exposure to an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 if the exposure was prolonged (10 minutes or more) or if the exposure was of concern (e.g., the individual coughed into the face of the law enforcement officer). This would best protect the health of the exposed worker, their co-workers, and the general public. However, if personnel and resources are not available, law enforcement personnel (considered critical infrastructure workers) may be permitted to work after exposure to ensure continuity of operations. To continue working, the exposed worker should remain symptom-free, and the employer should put into place the following prevention strategies for the exposed worker:  Screen the worker for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) before each work shift Regularly monitor the worker for symptoms, under the supervision of an occupational health program Ensure the worker practices social distancing (remaining at least 6 feet away from others) Ensure the worker wears a facemask (or cloth face covering if facemasks are unavailable) to protect others  If an exposed worker develops symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) and is still working, the employer should:  Send the worker home immediately and encourage them to follow CDC guidance for What to Do If You Are Sick. Clean and disinfect surfaces in their workspace. Follow CDC guidance to determine when the worker can return to work.

{"Question":"During the pandemic, what are the special considerations for surgery and procedures?","Answer":"As part of routine practices, healthcare personnel (HCP) should be applying Standard Precautions. HCP should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented at the point of care according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities:  consider nonoperative approaches when feasible; minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible; minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures; use the extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; and implement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having HCP wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility.  If surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to all recommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19. This includes:  Using all recommended PPE: an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown.  Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field. If shortages exist, N95 or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e.g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract).   As part of routine practice, HCP should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e.g., smoke evacuation devices).  Because COVID-19 can be transmitted asymptomatically, some infected individuals will not be identified based on clinical signs and symptoms. HCP providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having COVID-19 should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for universal eye protection and respirator use (see FAQ addressing recommended PPE when caring for asymptomatic patients who are not suspected to have COVID-19). HCP should continue to use eye protection or an N95 or higher-level respirator whenever recommended for patient care as a part of Standard or Transmission-Based Precautions.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":4.0}

{"Question":"What is the definition of community mitigation?","Answer":"Individuals, communities, schools, businesses and healthcare organizations all have a role to play in community mitigation. Policies*, which include limits on large gatherings, restrictions on businesses, and school closures are often needed to fully put in place community mitigation strategies. Each community is unique. Because some actions can be very disruptive to daily life, mitigation activities will be different depending on how much disease has spread within the community, what the community population is like, and the ability to take these actions at the local level. To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be impacted need to be considered, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness, and those who might be more impacted socially or economically.

{"Question":"What is the best way to conduct a point of care test if I don't have access to a lab?","Answer":"In areas with low COVID-19 prevalence, a two-stage specimen pooling approach can help preserve testing reagents and resources. In the first stage, several patients\u2019 specimens are combined before extraction, and then tested all at once. If the test comes back negative, then all of those patients can be cleared with one test. If the test comes back positive, then all of those specimens need to be extracted and re-tested individually. The lower the prevalence of the disease, the larger the optimal pool size can be. A recent studyexternal icon from the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory found that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 reliably return a positive result when one positive sample is mixed with four negatives. Researchers in Germany and Israel have had similar results. A pooling strategy is not efficient when the prevalence of COVID-19 is high. People with symptoms and people who have been exposed to someone with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should still be tested individually. Before using a pooling strategy, the laboratory must have the proper regulatory approvals.

{"Question":"What do I need to do if I have a relative that died overseas?","Answer":"CDC does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the United States. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceased\u2019s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office. CDC requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease. At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the United States and the remains must meet the standards for importation found in 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55 and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the United States only under the following conditions:  The remains are cremated; OR The remains are properly embalmed and placed in a hermetically sealed casket; OR The remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the CDC Director. The CDC permit (if applicable) must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment.  Permits for the importation of the remains of a person known or suspected to have died from a quarantinable communicable disease may be obtained through the CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine by calling the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 or emailing dgmqpolicyoffice@cdc.gov.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, \u201cstay at home orders,\u201d and limits to gatherings have affected the ability of friends and family to come together in person and grieve in typical ways. This is true regardless of whether the person\u2019s death was due to COVID-19 or some other cause. Fortunately, most people understand that hosting gatherings now could be dangerous to those who would want to participate. Family and friends are finding alternate ways to connect, support each other, and grieve after their loss. They understand the need to possibly plan for additional memorial services when COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted. Take actions to help you cope with the loss of a loved one Grief is a universal emotion, but no two people experience grief in exactly the same way. Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of grief while practicing social distancing and honoring your loved one include:  Invite people to call you, or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected. Ask family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via phone, video chat, email, text message, photo sharing apps, social media, or mailed letters. Create a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories. Coordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer from within their own households. Some cultures practice a prolonged mourning period with multiple observances, so hosting virtual events now and in-person events later may be in keeping with these practices. Seek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. People who are not part of a faith tradition or religious community can seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends. Use grief counseling services, support groups, or hotlines, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider. Read books about grief and loss. If you have children, read age-appropriate books with them and talk with them about how they are feeling. Take part in an activity that has significance to you and the loved one you have lost, such as planting flowers or a tree or preparing a favorite meal, in memory of your loved one. Review additional information from CDC on loss and grief, and ways to cope with stress and anxiety.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who died of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as people avoiding them or rejecting them. Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger toward other people. Some people may avoid contact with you, your family members, and friends when they would normally reach out to you. You can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with extended family, friends, and others in your community.

Identify any potential concerns and determine options to make changes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preserve traditional practices when it is possible to safely do so, and identify whether modified or new practices could satisfy the needs and values of you and your loved one.   Consider whether it would be acceptable to hold modified funeral arrangements by limiting attendance to a small number of immediate family members and friends shortly after the time of death. Consider holding additional memorial services in the future when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive.  When you are making decisions about who should attend, consider how emotionally difficult social distancing practices might be for attendees (such as keeping at least 6 feet apart and not hugging other attendees who do not live in their household).

{"Question":"What should I do before taking my child to the hospital during COVID-19?","Answer":"No. For patients hospitalized with COVID-19, decisions about discharge from the hospital should be based on their clinical status and the ability of the accepting facility to meet their care needs and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices. Decisions about hospital discharge are distinct from decisions about discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions. For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, decisions about discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions should be based on the strategies outlined here. The test-based strategy is NOT REQUIRED and might not be possible due to limitations on availability of testing. If a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has not met criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions, they should be transferred to a facility with the ability to adhere to infection prevention and control recommendations for the care of residents with COVID-19, including placement in a unit or area of the facility designated to care for residents with COVID-19 and provision of recommended personal protective equipment to healthcare personnel. If the patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has met the criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions but has persistent symptoms (e.g., persistent cough), they should ideally be placed in a single room, be restricted to their room to the extent possible, and wear a facemask (if tolerated) during care activities until all symptoms are completely resolved or at baseline. If the patient has met the criteria for discontinuing Transmission-Based Precautions and does not have persistent symptoms, they do not require additional restrictions. A patient hospitalized for non-COVID-related illnesses whose COVID-19 status is not known can be transferred to a nursing home without testing.

{"Question":"If a COVID-19 patient is in an exam room, how long should that room stay empty before being used for another patient?","Answer":"Although spread of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be primarily via respiratory droplets, the contribution of small respirable particles to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. Airborne transmission from person-to- person over long distances is unlikely. The amount of time that the air inside an examination room remains potentially infectious is not known and may depend on a number of factors including the size of the room, the number of air changes per hour, how long the patient was in the room, if the patient was coughing or sneezing, and if an aerosol- generating procedure was performed. Facilities will need to consider these factors when deciding when the vacated room can be entered by someone who is not wearing PPE. For a patient who was not coughing or sneezing, did not undergo an aerosol- generating procedure, and occupied the room for a short period of time (e.g., a few minutes), any risk to HCP and subsequent patients likely dissipates over a matter of minutes. However, for a patient who was coughing and remained in the room for a longer period of time or underwent an aerosol-generating procedure, the risk period is likely longer. For these higher risk scenarios, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period as that used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) and to restrict HCP and patients without PPE from entering the room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. General guidance on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available. In addition to ensuring sufficient time for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles, HCP should clean and disinfect environmental surfaces and shared equipment before the room is used for another patient.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":4.0}

Teach your children to do the same.  Clean hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid people who are sick (coughing and sneezing). Put distance between your children and other people outside of your home. Keep children at least 6 feet from other people. Children 2 years and older should wear acloth face covering over their nose and mouth when in public settings where it\u2019s difficult to practice social distancing. This is an additional public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to (not instead of) the other everyday preventive actions listed above. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (like tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, and sinks). Launder items including washable plush toys as needed. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely.

For example, the duty belt or other non-porous items can be disinfected using products that are EPA-approved for use against the virusexternal icon. Porous items, like the uniform, should be replaced as soon as possible and then laundered according to manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. This is especially important if any body fluids were expelled during the encounter (bloodborne pathogen protocols should also be followed if applicable). Gloves should be worn when touching potentially contaminated items or applying disinfectants and it is important to perform hand hygiene upon removing gloves or other PPE. Law enforcement personnel who have an exposure should be evaluated by their occupational health program and may be able to finish their work shift before starting home isolation. If personnel and resources are available, it is most protective for law enforcement personnel to stay at home until 14 days after exposure to an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 if the exposure was prolonged (10 minutes or more) or if the exposure was of concern (e.g., the individual coughed into the face of the law enforcement officer). This would best protect the health of the exposed worker, their co-workers, and the general public. However, if personnel and resources are not available, law enforcement personnel (considered critical infrastructure workers) may be permitted to work after exposure to ensure continuity of operations. To continue working, the exposed worker should remain symptom-free, and the employer should put into place the following prevention strategies for the exposed worker:  Screen the worker for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) before each work shift Regularly monitor the worker for symptoms, under the supervision of an occupational health program Ensure the worker practices social distancing (remaining at least 6 feet away from others) Ensure the worker wears a facemask (or cloth face covering if facemasks are unavailable) to protect others  If an exposed worker develops symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) and is still working, the employer should:  Send the worker home immediately and encourage them to follow CDC guidance for What to Do If You Are Sick. Clean and disinfect surfaces in their workspace. Follow CDC guidance to determine when the worker can return to work.

{"Question":"Can someone who has had Covid 19 get it again?","Answer":"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community\u2019s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator). Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.

{"Question":"When to use SARS-CoV-2 viral test versus serology (antibody) test when both have received EUA from FDA?","Answer":"FDA has authorized EUAs for both viral and antibody tests for COVID-19. Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS- CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19. Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS- CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2. If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed.

{"Question":"We are in laboratories obtain reagents for COVID-19 testing?","Answer":"FDA has authorized EUAs for both viral and antibody tests for COVID-19. Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS- CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19. Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS- CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2. If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed.

N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles. Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely. Achieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check each time the respirator is used. Workers must pass a fit test to confirm a proper seal before using a respirator in the workplace. When properly fitted and worn, minimal leakage occurs around edges of the respirator when the user inhales. This means almost all of the air is directed through the filter media. Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks.

{"Question":"How can I prevent other people catching COVID-19 from me if I am sick?","Answer":"Know how it spreads  There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.  Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.    Wash your hands often  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact  Avoid close contact with people who are sick, even inside your home. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members. Put distance between yourself and other people outside of your home.  Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from other people. Do not gather in groups. Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings. Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.    Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others  You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities.  Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.   The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected. Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker. Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.  Cover coughs and sneezes  If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.

{"Question":"How can I prevent other people catching COVID-19 from me if I am sick?","Answer":"Know how it spreads  There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.  Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.    Wash your hands often  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact  Avoid close contact with people who are sick, even inside your home. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members. Put distance between yourself and other people outside of your home.  Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from other people. Do not gather in groups. Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings. Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.    Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others  You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities.  Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.   The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected. Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker. Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.  Cover coughs and sneezes  If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

{"Question":"How can me and my roommates stay safe?","Answer":"Be flexible, rules may change in common areas. Maintain 6 feet of social (physical) distance between yourself and everyone that you do not live with. This may mean there will be alternatives to activities, cancelled activities, or closed areas. If you see people in areas that are small, like stairwells and elevators, consider going one at a time. Here are some examples of how the rules in common spaces may change: Shared kitchens, dining rooms, laundry rooms, bathrooms  Access should be available, but the number of people should be restricted so that everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart from one another. People who are sick, their roommates, and those who have higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should eat or be fed in their room, if possible. Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, or eating utensils. Non-disposable food service items used should be handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Guidelines for doing laundry such as washing instructions and handling of dirty laundry should be posted. Sinks could be an infection source and should avoid placing toothbrushes directly on counter surfaces. Totes can be used for personal items so they do not touch the bathroom countertop.  Recreational areas such as activity rooms, exercise rooms, pools, and hot tubs  Consider closing or restricting the number of people allowed in at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart, except for essential activities only, such as water therapy.

{"Question":"What risks are associated with using an expired respirator?","Answer":"An N95 respirator with an exhalation valve does provide the same level of protection to the wearer as one that does not have a valve. The presence of an exhalation valve reduces exhalation resistance, which makes it easier to breathe (exhale). Some users feel that a respirator with an exhalation valve keeps the face cooler and reduces moisture build up inside the facepiece. However, respirators with exhalation valves should not be used in situations where a sterile field must be maintained (e.g., during an invasive procedure in an operating or procedure room) because the exhalation valve allows unfiltered exhaled air to escape into the sterile field.","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":1.25}

{"Question":"What risks are associated with using an expired respirator?","Answer":"In times of increased demand and decreased supply, consideration can be made to use N95 respirators past their intended shelf life.

{"Question":"Will chest CT be useful against coronavirus?","Answer":"Antibody testing checks a sample of a person\u2019s blood to look for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These antibodies are produced when someone has been infected, so a positive result from this test indicates that person was previously infected with the virus. CDC is working with other federal agencies to evaluate the performance of commercially manufactured antibody tests that are becoming increasingly available from healthcare providers. This evaluation is expected to be completed in early May. We do not know yet if the antibodies that result from infection with SARS- CoV-2 can protect someone from reinfection with this virus (immunity) or how long antibodies to the virus will protect someone. Scientists are conducting research to answer those questions. Antibody tests may not be able to tell you if you are currently infected because it typically takes 1 to 3 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

{"Question":"How should I clean and disinfect surfaces at a retirement home?","Answer":"How to clean and disinfect Clean  Wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect. Clean surfaces using soap and water, then use disinfectant. Cleaning with soap and water reduces number of germs, dirt and impurities on the surface. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.   More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. Surfaces and objects in public places, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads should be cleaned and disinfected before each use.   High touch surfaces include: Tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.    Disinfect   Recommend use of EPA-registered household disinfectant . Follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many products recommend:  Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see product label). Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.    Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used if appropriate for the surface.   Check the label to see if your bleach is intended for disinfection, and ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Leave solution on the surface for at least 1 minute.  To make a bleach solution , mix:      5 tablespoons (1\/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water OR   4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water     Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.  Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.  Soft surfaces For soft surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes  Clean the surface using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces. Launder items (if possible) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely.  OR  Disinfect with an EPA-registered household disinfectant. These disinfectants meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against COVID-19. Vacuum as usual.  Electronics For electronics, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines  Consider putting a wipeable cover on electronics. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instruction for cleaning and disinfecting.  If no guidance, use alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol. Dry surface thoroughly.    Laundry For clothing, towels, linens and other items  Launder items according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely. Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from a person who is sick. Dirty laundry from a person who is sick can be washed with other people\u2019s items. Do not shake dirty laundry. Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. Remove gloves, and wash hands right away.  Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas  Outdoor areas, like playgrounds in schools and parks generally require normal routine cleaning , but do not require disinfection. Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds- it is not an efficient use of supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID-19 to the public. High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended.   Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected. Spread of COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective.    When cleaning  Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces.  Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals.   Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash.  Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the cleaning\/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area.   Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.  Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person who is sick. Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.   Additional key times to wash hands include:  After blowing one\u2019s nose, coughing, or sneezing. After using the restroom. Before eating or preparing food. After contact with animals or pets. Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance (e.g., a child).    Additional considerations for employers  Educate workers performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick-up to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19. Provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus. Develop policies for worker protection and provide training to all cleaning staff on site prior to providing cleaning tasks.  Training should include when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of PPE.   Ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA\u2019s Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). Comply with OSHA\u2019s standards on Bloodborne Pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030), including proper disposal of regulated waste, and PPE (29 CFR 1910.132).  Alternative disinfection methods  The efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light against COVID-19 virus is not known.

{"Question":"How should I clean and disinfect surfaces at a retirement home?","Answer":"How to clean and disinfect Clean  Wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect. Clean surfaces using soap and water, then use disinfectant. Cleaning with soap and water reduces number of germs, dirt and impurities on the surface. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.   More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. Surfaces and objects in public places, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads should be cleaned and disinfected before each use.   High touch surfaces include: Tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.    Disinfect   Recommend use of EPA-registered household disinfectant . Follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many products recommend:  Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see product label). Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.    Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used if appropriate for the surface.   Check the label to see if your bleach is intended for disinfection, and ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Leave solution on the surface for at least 1 minute.  To make a bleach solution , mix:      5 tablespoons (1\/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water OR   4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water     Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.  Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.  Soft surfaces For soft surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes  Clean the surface using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces. Launder items (if possible) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely.  OR  Disinfect with an EPA-registered household disinfectant. These disinfectants meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against COVID-19. Vacuum as usual.  Electronics For electronics, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines  Consider putting a wipeable cover on electronics. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instruction for cleaning and disinfecting.  If no guidance, use alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol. Dry surface thoroughly.    Laundry For clothing, towels, linens and other items  Launder items according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely. Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from a person who is sick. Dirty laundry from a person who is sick can be washed with other people\u2019s items. Do not shake dirty laundry. Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. Remove gloves, and wash hands right away.  Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas  Outdoor areas, like playgrounds in schools and parks generally require normal routine cleaning , but do not require disinfection. Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds- it is not an efficient use of supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID-19 to the public. High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended.   Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected. Spread of COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective.    When cleaning  Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces.  Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals.   Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash.  Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the cleaning\/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area.   Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.  Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person who is sick. Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.   Additional key times to wash hands include:  After blowing one\u2019s nose, coughing, or sneezing. After using the restroom. Before eating or preparing food. After contact with animals or pets. Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance (e.g., a child).    Additional considerations for employers  Educate workers performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick-up to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19. Provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus. Develop policies for worker protection and provide training to all cleaning staff on site prior to providing cleaning tasks.  Training should include when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of PPE.   Ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA\u2019s Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). Comply with OSHA\u2019s standards on Bloodborne Pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030), including proper disposal of regulated waste, and PPE (29 CFR 1910.132).  Alternative disinfection methods  The efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light against COVID-19 virus is not known.  EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19.   CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels.

{"Question":"How do I practice social distancing?","Answer":"COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. COVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sunlight, humidity, and the type of surface. Social distancing helps limit opportunities to come in contact with contaminated surfaces and infected people outside the home. Although the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone, anyone can get and spread COVID-19. Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community.","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":1.0}

Before you begin working a long stretch of shifts, try \u201cbanking your sleep\u201d \u2013 sleeping several extra hours longer than you normally do. After you\u2019ve worked a long stretch of shifts, remember it may take several days of extended sleep (for example, 10 hours in bed) before you begin to feel recovered. Give yourself time to recover. Avoid sunlight or bright lights 90 minutes before you go to sleep, when possible. Exposure to light just before bedtime can cause you to feel more awake.  If you work a night shift and drive home during sunlight hours, try wearing sunglasses to reduce your exposure to sunlight during your drive home. Consider using blackout shades at home when sleeping.   Take naps when you have the opportunity.  A 90-minute nap before working a night shift can help prevent you from feeling tired at work.   Eat healthy foods and stay physically active because it can improve your sleep. Before you go to sleep, avoid foods and drinks that can make falling asleep more difficult:  Avoid alcohol, heavy meals, and nicotine for at least 2\u20133 hours before bedtime. Don\u2019t drink caffeine within 5 hours of bedtime.    Know what to do if you feel too tired to work safely.  Use a buddy system while you\u2019re at work. Check in with each other to ensure everyone is coping with work hours and demands. Watch yourself and your coworkers for signs of fatigue \u2014 like yawning, difficulty keeping your eyes open, and difficulty concentrating. When you see something, say something to your coworkers so you can prevent workplace injuries and errors. Find out if your employer has a formal program to help you manage fatigue on the job. Read information about the program and ask questions so you fully understand your employer\u2019s policies and procedures for helping employees manage fatigue. Report any fatigue-related events or close-calls to a manager to help prevent injuries and errors. Do not work if your fatigue threatens the safety of yourself or others. Report to a manager when you feel too tired to work safely. ","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":4.0}
{"Question":"What can workers do to combat fatigue while working during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Answer":" Communicate with your coworkers, supervisors, and employees about job stress while maintaining social distancing (at least 6 feet).  Identify things that cause stress and work together to identify solutions. Talk openly with employers, employees, and unions about how the pandemic is affecting work. Expectations should be communicated clearly by everyone. Ask about how to access mental health resources in your workplace.   Identify those things which you do not have control over and do the best you can with the resources available to you. Increase your sense of control by developing a consistent daily routine when possible \u2014 ideally one that is similar to your schedule before the pandemic.  Keep a regular sleep scheduleexternal icon. Take breaks from work to stretch, exercise, or check in with your supportive colleagues, coworkers, family, and friends. Spend time outdoors, either being physically active or relaxing. If you work from home, set a regular time to end your work for the day, if possible. Practice mindfulness techniquesexternal icon. Do things you enjoy during non-work hours.   Know the facts about COVID-19. Be informed about how to protect yourself and others. Understanding the risk and sharing accurate information with people you care about can reduce stress and help you make a connection with others. Remind yourself that each of us has a crucial role in fighting this pandemic. Remind yourself that everyone is in an unusual situation with limited resources. Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting and mentally exhausting Connect with others. Talk with people you trust about your concerns, how you are feeling, or how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting you.  Connect with others through phone calls, email, text messages, mailing letters or cards, video chat, and social media. Check on others. Helping others improves your sense of control, belonging, and self-esteem. Look for safe ways to offer social support to others, especially if they are showing signs of stress, such as depression and anxiety.   If you feel you may be misusing alcohol or other drugs (including prescription drugs) as a means of coping, reach out for help.

{"Question":"What can workers do to combat fatigue while working during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Answer":" Recognize that these are stressful and unusual circumstances and risk for fatigue may be increased. Create a culture of safety with clear coordination and communication between management and workers. This can include establishing a Fatigue Risk Management Plan or strategies for fatigue mitigation on the job. Share and ensure that employees understand the processes. Spot the signs and symptoms of fatigue (e.g., yawning, difficulty keeping eyes open, inability to concentrate) in yourself and your employees and take steps to mitigate fatigue-related injury or error.  The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a short survey that can be posted in a common area for workers to quickly rate their fatigue. Create a procedure that does not punish workers for reporting when they, or their coworkers, are too fatigued to work safely. Build it into team comradery as an example of how management and staff can support each other. Develop processes to relieve a worker from their duties if they are too fatigued to work safely.  If available, and agreeable with workers, consider assigning workers who are just starting their shifts onto safety-critical tasks. If possible, rotate workers or groups of workers through tasks that are repetitive and\/or strenuous. Tools or workstations that are unavoidably shared need to be properly cleaned and disinfected between usage. If possible, schedule physically and mentally demanding workloads and monotonous work in shorter shifts and\/or during day shifts.   Provide information for workers on the consequences of sleep deprivation and resources to assist workers manage fatigue. Allow staff enough time to organize their off-duty obligations and get sufficient rest and recovery.  Schedule at least 11 hours off in-between shifts (each 24-hour period), and one full day of rest per seven days for adequate sleep and recovery. Avoid penalizing those who may have restricted availability to work extra shifts\/longer hours (e.g., caring for dependents).   If rotating shift work is needed, use forward rotations (day to evening to night) and provide staff with sufficient notice when scheduling, particularly if there is a shift change. Avoid scheduling staff for more than 12 hours, if possible.  Formalize and encourage regularly scheduled breaks in clean and safe areas where social distancing can be maintained. Recognize the need for additional time for increased hand hygiene and putting on and taking off required personal protective equipment (PPE).   Provide alternative transportation to and from work and mandatory paid rest time prior to driving commutes after work, when possible.   Consider arranging for nearby offsite housing for those working extended shifts and at high risk for COVID-19, such as health care workers. Nearby housing will reduce travel times, allowing for more rest and recovery.   ","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":4.0}

Stay home if you are sick  If you develop a fever or symptoms, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider for medical advice before visiting their office. You should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, after talking with your doctor.  Wear a cloth face covering  CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are hard to do, especially in areas that have high rates of COVID infection. Cloth face coverings may help prevent people who don\u2019t know they have the virus from spreading it to others. These face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators and are not appropriate substitutes for them in workplaces where masks or respirators are recommended or required.  Limit Contact  Practice contactless deliveries whenever you can. Contactless deliveries allow you to leave a delivery at a doorstep, move back to a distance greater than 6 feet away while verifying receipt of the delivery with the recipient (if required), and try to do everything electronically whenever you can (e.g., in an app or over a phone). This eliminates the need for close contact between you and delivery recipient. Maintain a distance 6 feet or greater from others you might meet or need to speak to while making your deliveries. Limit contact with frequently touched surfaces during deliveries, such as doorbells or door handles. Use a foot, shoulder, elbow, hip, or forearm when opening doors, instead of hands, if possible. Avoid sharing scanners, pens, or other tools with customers. If you are wearing machine-washable work gloves normally worn for the job throughout your shift, do not touch your face with gloved hands.

{"Question":"Do alternative disinfection methods work against COVID-19?","Answer":" Hydrogen peroxide-based systems for cleaning, disinfecting, and storing contact lenses should be effective against the virus that causes COVID-19.  For other disinfection methods, such as multipurpose solution and ultrasonic cleaners, there is currently not enough scientific evidence to determine efficacy against the virus.   Always use solution to disinfect your contact lenses and case to kill germs that may be present. Handle your lenses over a surface that has been cleaned and disinfected.

Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person.   Look for ways to make learning fun. Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things. Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks. Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact. Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience.

If you have not received a letter from the NHS then you may not be able to receive the support offered through this service. If you urgently need food or care, contact your local council. Getting your prescriptions Prescriptions will continue to cover the same length of time as usual. If you do not currently have your prescriptions collected or delivered, you can arrange this by:  Asking someone who can pick up your prescription from the local pharmacy (this is the best option, if possible). Contacting your pharmacy to ask them to deliver your prescription to you or to help you find a volunteer (who will have been ID checked) to deliver it.  You may also need to arrange for collection or delivery of hospital specialist medication that is prescribed to you by your hospital care team. If you receive support from health and social care organisations, such as having care provided for you through the local authority or health care system, this will continue as normal. Your health or social care provider will be asked to take additional precautions to make sure that you are protected. The advice for formal carers is included in the home care provision.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":3.5}

{"Question":"Do I need a face mask on public transportation?","Answer":"If you can, wear a face covering if you need to use public transport. There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure. The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not yet developed symptoms. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and police staff for the purposes of identification. A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment. These should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings, like those exposed to dust hazards. Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by the law. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and after taking them off. Consider making a list of items to take with you and minimise the luggage you take.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":4.0}

{"Question":"Do I need a face mask on public transportation?","Answer":"Passengers and people working on the transport network should keep their distance from people outside their household, recognising that this will not always be possible. The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact. You are very unlikely to be infected from walking past another person. Public Health England (PHE) recommends trying to keep 2 metres away from people, where possible, as a precaution. However, this is not a rule and the science is complex. The key thing is to not be too close to people for more than a short amount of time, as much as you can. Employers should advise staff and passengers on ways of working to keep their distance from other people as much as possible. There are situations where this may not be possible, for example when boarding or alighting, during security checks, on busier services, busier times of day, when walking through interchanges and when undertaking maintenance work that requires two people for the task. Where social distancing is not possible try to minimise the time spent within 2 metres of others, and keep groups of workers in teams that are as small as possible (\u201ccohorting\u201d). For example, keeping maintenance crews working together, rather than mixing crew members on different shifts. Organisations could consider:  Creating and agreeing a single, clear approach to social distancing for all workers and passengers.  Agreeing and maintaining clear rules for workers and passengers that meet social distancing guidelines, for example:  Clear rules for interacting with passengers, receiving goods, and testing equipment. Support individual workers who choose to use face coverings in situations where social distancing is not possible.  Organising the workspace and how people work in a single space to follow social distancing guidelines, such as:   Separating workspaces 2 metres apart from one another, where possible.  Use of screens or barriers. Eliminating face-to-face seating, for example, shift to \u2018bench\u2019 style. Repositioning workspaces to allow for optimal ventilation. Reducing occupancy of group interaction spaces, including spaces shared with other organisations. Adjustments for those with specific needs or protected characteristics, for example disabled people, the elderly and pregnant women. Consider groups of people who process information differently or who may not be able to distance from others.    Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect against coronavirus outside of clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case. Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non- COVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so. When managing the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE.

{"Question":"How should I be interacting with my customers at a takeout restaurant?","Answer":"In this section  4.1 Manage contacts 4.2 Providing and explaining available guidance  4.1 Manage contacts Objective: To minimise the contact resulting from visits to restaurants, bars and cafes offering takeaway or delivery services. Steps that will usually be needed:   Providing handwashing and hand sanitiser and encourage visitors to wash their hands regularly.   Regulating entry so that the premises do not become overcrowded, and placing 2m markers on the floor to maintain social distancing inside the premises.   Providing clear guidance on social distancing and hygiene to people on arrival, for example, signage, visual aids and before arrival, such as by phone, on the website or by email.   Determining if schedules for essential services and contractor visits can be revised to reduce interaction and overlap between people, for example, carrying out services at night.   4.1.1 Selling food or drink Objective: To minimise interactions with outside workers and the public when selling food or drinks. Steps that will usually be needed:   Minimising contact between kitchen workers and front of house workers, delivery drivers or riders, for example, by having zones from which delivery drivers can collect packaged food items.   Using front of house staff to serve customers purchasing food and drink, minimising the time they spend in the kitchen.   Creating a physical barrier such as a screen, between front of house workers and customers where possible.   Encouraging contactless payments where possible.   Limiting access to premises for people waiting for or collecting takeaways. Setting out clear demarcation for 2m distances for customers queuing. Asking customers to wait in their cars.   Asking customers to order online, on apps or over the telephone to reduce queues and stagger pick up times.   Making regular announcements to remind customers to follow social distancing advice and clean their hands regularly.   4.2 Providing and explaining available guidance Objective: To make sure people understand what they need to do to maintain safety.

{"Question":"What are the important steps employers need to take to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19?","Answer":"Objective: To reduce risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures, in order of priority. Employers have a duty to reduce workplace risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures. Employers must work with any other employers or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybody\u2019s health and safety is protected. In the context of COVID-19 this means working through these steps in order:   In every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.   Businesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to enable working from home as a first option. Where working from home is not possible, workplaces should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (keeping people 2m apart wherever possible).   Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.      Further mitigating actions include:   \u2013 increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning \u2013 keeping the activity time involved as short as possible \u2013 using screens or barriers to separate people from each other \u2013 using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible \u2013 reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using \u2018fixed teams or partnering\u2019 (so each person works with only a few others)  Finally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead.

{"Question":"If my labor is being induced, will my birth partner be able to be with me?","Answer":"We fully support women having their birth partners with them during labour and birth, unless they are unwell, when an alternative well birth partner can attend. Around one in four women in the UK has a caesarean birth. A caesarean may be recommended as a planned (elective) procedure for medical reasons or as an emergency \u2013 for example, if doctors and midwives are concerned that your baby is not coping with labour and needs to be born immediately. Furthermore, around one in five women in the UK has an instrumental birth (ventouse or forceps). Some of these types of birth may also be recommended to occur in an operating theatre in order to allow the maternity team to modify plans and undertake a caesarean birth if necessary. Most caesareans and instrumental births in theatre are carried out under spinal or epidural anaesthetic, which means you\u2019ll be awake, but the lower part of your body is numb and you cannot feel any pain. In this situation, everything will be done by the clinical staff \u2013 midwives, obstetricians and anaesthetists \u2013 to keep your birth partner with you. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, staff in the operating theatre will be wearing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of infection, which will make it more difficult for them to communicate. To enable the clinicians to assist in the birth of your baby safely, it\u2019s really important your birth partner follows the instructions from the maternity team carefully and quickly. Occasionally, a general anaesthetic (where you\u2019re put to sleep) may be used, particularly if your baby needs to be born urgently. During this type of caesarean birth, even under more usual circumstances, for safety reasons it is not possible for the birth partner to be present during the birth. While the maternity team will do all they can to ensure that your birth partner is present for the birth, there will be some occasions when there is a need for an urgent emergency birth with epidural or spinal anaesthetic, and it will not be possible for your birth partner to be present. This is because, during an emergency, operating theatres are more high-risk environments in terms of potential spread of coronavirus to everyone who is present. If it is the case that your birth partner will not be able to be present during the birth, your maternity team will explain this to you and will do everything they can to ensure that your birth partner can see you and your baby as soon as possible after the birth.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":4.0}

In this situation, everything will be done by the clinical staff \u2013 midwives, obstetricians and anaesthetists \u2013 to keep your birth partner with you. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, staff in the operating theatre will be wearing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of infection, which will make it more difficult for them to communicate. To enable the clinicians to assist in the birth of your baby safely, it\u2019s really important your birth partner follows the instructions from the maternity team carefully and quickly. Occasionally, a general anaesthetic (where you\u2019re put to sleep) may be used, particularly if your baby needs to be born urgently. During this type of caesarean birth, even under more usual circumstances, for safety reasons it is not possible for the birth partner to be present during the birth. While the maternity team will do all they can to ensure that your birth partner is present for the birth, there will be some occasions when there is a need for an urgent emergency birth with epidural or spinal anaesthetic, and it will not be possible for your birth partner to be present. This is because, during an emergency, operating theatres are more high-risk environments in terms of potential spread of coronavirus to everyone who is present. If it is the case that your birth partner will not be able to be present during the birth, your maternity team will explain this to you and will do everything they can to ensure that your birth partner can see you and your baby as soon as possible after the birth.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":4.0}

If a child is awaiting collection, they should be moved, if possible, to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door, depending on the age of the child and with appropriate adult supervision if required. Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation. If it is not possible to isolate them, move them to an area which is at least 2 metres away from other people. If they need to go to the bathroom while waiting to be collected, they should use a separate bathroom if possible. The bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected using standard cleaning products before being used by anyone else. PPE should be worn by staff caring for the child while they await collection if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained (such as for a very young child or a child with complex needs). In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital.

{"Question":"What steps should be taken in foster care settings if a child shows symptoms of COVID-19?","Answer":"When a child, young person or staff member develops symptoms compatible with coronavirus, they should be sent home and advised to self-isolate for 7 days. Their fellow household members should self-isolate for 14 days. All staff and students who are attending an education or childcare setting will have access to a test if they display symptoms of coronavirus, and are encouraged to get tested in this scenario. Where the child, young person or staff member tests negative, they can return to their setting and the fellow household members can end their self- isolation. Where the child, young person or staff member tests positive, the rest of their class or group within their childcare or education setting should be sent home and advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The other household members of that wider class or group do not need to self-isolate unless the child, young person or staff member they live with in that group subsequently develops symptoms. As part of the national test and trace programme, if other cases are detected within the cohort or in the wider setting, Public Health England\u2019s local health protection teams will conduct a rapid investigation and will advise schools and other settings on the most appropriate action to take.

{"Question":"What can I do to reduce my chances of catching the coronavirus while pregnant?","Answer":"All available evidence suggests that pregnant women are at no greater risk of becoming seriously unwell than other healthy adults if they develop coronavirus. The large majority of pregnant women experience only mild or moderate cold\/flu-like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, headache and loss or change to your sense of smell or taste are other relevant symptoms. If you think you may have symptoms of coronavirus you should use the NHS 111 online service for information, or NHS 24 if in Scotland. If you develop more severe symptoms or your recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that you are developing a more significant chest infection that requires specialised care. If you feel your symptoms are worsening or if you are not getting better, you should contact your maternity care team, your GP, or use the NHS 111 online service \/ NHS 24 for further information and advice. In an emergency, call 999. While pregnant women are at no greater risk of becoming seriously unwell than other healthy adults, a small proportion of pregnant women with coronavirus have required admission to hospital for treatment. In the UK, information about all pregnant women requiring admission to hospital with coronavirus is recorded in a registry called the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS). The first report from this study included information about the outcomes of 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with coronavirus and their babies during the pandemic, and was published on 11 May. While most women in the study required only ward treatment and were discharged home well, around one in ten women required intensive care, and sadly five women with coronavirus died, although it is currently unclear if coronavirus was the cause of their death. The study found that the majority of women who did become severely ill were in their third trimester of pregnancy, emphasising the importance of social distancing from 28 weeks of pregnancy. The study also found that pregnant women from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds were more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital for coronavirus. Pregnant women over the age of 35, those who were overweight or obese, and those who had pre-existing medical problems, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, were also at higher risk of developing severe illness.","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":1.0}

{"Question":"What can I do to reduce my chances of catching the coronavirus while pregnant?","Answer":"There is no evidence that women who have recently had a baby and are otherwise well are at increased risk of contracting coronavirus or of becoming seriously unwell. A recently pregnant woman\u2019s immune system is regarded as normal unless she has other forms of infection or underlying illness. You should however remain well-nourished with a balanced diet, take mild exercise as you feel fit and ensure social distancing guidance is followed. Children, including newborns, do not appear to be at high risk of becoming seriously unwell with the virus. However, close observation of hygiene, as always, is important and particularly with family members resident in the house. Anyone who enters the home should take standard hygiene precautions, including washing their hands, and be careful about handling your baby if they have symptoms of any illness including the coronavirus. It is important that your baby is feeding well and gaining weight, and if you have any concerns, please contact your midwife. Once restrictions are lifted, we would caution against large family gatherings to celebrate your baby\u2019s arrival until more is known about the spread of the virus in the community. Do not put off seeking medical advice if you have concerns about your baby\u2019s health during the pandemic. Seek medical advice if your baby has a fever, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding or any other symptoms you may have concerns about.","Rating":"Acceptable","Score":3,"Average":2.25}

{"Question":"What rules should office workers follow when wearing PPE to prevent the spread of COVID-19?","Answer":"There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure. The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not developed symptoms. A face covering can be very simple and may be worn in enclosed spaces where social distancing isn\u2019t possible. It just needs to cover your mouth and nose. It is not the same as a face mask, such as the surgical masks or respirators used by health and care workers. Similarly, face coverings are not the same as the PPE used to manage risks like dust and spray in an industrial context. Supplies of PPE, including face masks, must continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards. It is important to know that the evidence of the benefit of using a face covering to protect others is weak and the effect is likely to be small, therefore face coverings are not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk, including minimising time spent in contact, using fixed teams and partnering for close-up work, and increasing hand and surface washing. These other measures remain the best ways of managing risk in the workplace and government would therefore not expect to see employers relying on face coverings as risk management for the purpose of their health and safety assessments. Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by law, including in the workplace. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the purposes of identification. Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely if they choose to wear one. This means telling workers:  wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and after removing it when wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands change your face covering if it becomes damp or if you\u2019ve touched it continue to wash your hands regularly change and wash your face covering daily if the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

{"Question":"Are local authorities responsible for co-ordinating a response to the coronavirus?","Answer":"We are asking schools to remain open for children of critical workers and vulnerable children where they can, but we understand that some may be unable to do so especially if they are experiencing severe staff shortages. Local authorities should therefore work with maintained, academy and independent schools to identify temporary places for any children affected whilst their normal schools are closed. If a school is unable to open, local authorities should try to co-ordinate provision for pupils in other schools in their area.

{"Question":"Are local authorities responsible for co-ordinating a response to the coronavirus?","Answer":"We are asking schools to remain open for children of critical workers and vulnerable children where they can, but we understand that some may be unable to do so especially if they are experiencing severe staff shortages. Local authorities should therefore work with maintained, academy and independent schools to identify temporary places for any children affected whilst their normal schools are closed. If a school is unable to open, local authorities should try to co-ordinate provision for pupils in other schools in their area.

This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas, for example, on public transport or in some shops. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the purposes of identification. Evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you. However, if you are infected but have not yet developed symptoms, it may provide some protection for others you come into close contact with. Face coverings do not replace social distancing. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, and\/or high temperature, and\/or loss of, or change in, your normal sense of smell or taste - anosmia), you and your household must isolate at home: wearing a face covering does not change this. A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment. These should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings, like those exposed to dust hazards. Face coverings should not be used by children under the age of 2 or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly. For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions. It is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off. You can make face-coverings at home. The key thing is it should cover the mouth and nose.","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":2.0}

This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take.

{"Question":"What is the best way to do risk management in a factory or warehouse?","Answer":"Objective: To reduce risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures, in order of priority. Employers have a duty to reduce workplace risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures. Employers must work with any other employers or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybody\u2019s health and safety is protected. In the context of COVID-19 this means working through these steps in order:   In every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.   Businesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to enable working from home as a first option. Where working from home is not possible, workplaces should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (keeping people 2m apart wherever possible).   Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.      Further mitigating actions include:   \u2013 increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning   \u2013 keeping the activity time involved as short as possible \u2013 using screens or barriers to separate people from each other \u2013 using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible \u2013 reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using \u2018fixed teams or partnering\u2019 (so each person works with only a few others)  Finally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment.     In this assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people doing the work are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. The recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you should consider as you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has been produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations or trades unions. If you have not already done so, you should carry out an assessment of the risks posed by COVID-19 in your workplace as soon as possible. If you are currently operating, you are likely to have gone through a lot of this thinking already.

Further mitigating actions include:   \u2013 increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning   \u2013 keeping the activity time involved as short as possible \u2013 using screens or barriers to separate people from each other \u2013 using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible \u2013 reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using \u2018fixed teams or partnering\u2019 (so each person works with only a few others)  Finally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead. No one is obliged to work in an unsafe work environment.     In this assessment you should have particular regard to whether the people doing the work are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. The recommendations in the rest of this document are ones you should consider as you go through this process. You could also consider any advice that has been produced specifically for your sector, for example by trade associations or trades unions. If you have not already done so, you should carry out an assessment of the risks posed by COVID-19 in your workplace as soon as possible. If you are currently operating, you are likely to have gone through a lot of this thinking already. We recommend that you use this document to identify any further improvements you should make. *[COVID-19]: coronavirus","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":3.5}
{"Question":"What are the full restrictions and guidance regarding social distancing against coronavirus?","Answer":"It is still very important that people stay home unless necessary to go out for specific reasons set out in law. These include:  for work, where you cannot work from home going to shops that are permitted to be open \u2013 to get things like food and medicine, and to collect goods ordered online or on the phone to exercise or spend time outdoors for recreation any medical need, to donate blood, avoid injury or illness, escape risk of harm, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person  Where parents or someone with parental responsibility do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents\u2019 homes to continue existing arrangements for access and contact. The government has also identified a number of critical workers whose children can still go to school or their childcare provider. This critical worker definition does not affect whether or not you can travel to work - if you are not a critical worker, you may still travel to work if you cannot work from home. However, if you, or a member of your household are unwell with symptoms of coronavirus, you should isolate and should not travel to or attend the workplace. Critical workers and parents or guardians of vulnerable children may leave their home to take children to and from school or their childcare provider. You can also attend the funeral of a close family member or member of your household (or, of a friend, if no one from their close family or household is attending). Religious ministers or leaders can leave their homes to go to their place of worship, but these should remain closed to the public You may also leave or be outside of your home in order to access other critical public services, such as social services, support provided to victims, services provided by the Department for Work and Pensions, to fulfil a legal obligation, or to move home in line with the government\u2019s guidance. A fuller list of the reasons you can leave home is set out in the regulations. When you do need to go out, you should follow the guidelines on staying safe outside your home. Most importantly, this includes the key advice that you should stay two metres apart from anyone outside of your household. Face coverings can help us protect each other and reduce the spread of the disease if you are in an enclosed space where social distancing isn\u2019t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas, for example on public transport or in some shops. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the purposes of identification. It is still not permitted to leave your house to visit friends and family in their home. The government is looking at how to facilitate greater contact with close family or friends, and will explain how this can be done safely in the coming weeks. By following this guidance, you are helping to protect yourself, your family, the NHS and your community.

It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory protective equipment, such as face masks. Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non- COVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so. At the start of this document we described the steps you need to take to manage COVID-19 risk in the workplace. This includes working from home and staying 2m away from each other in the workplace if at all possible.When managing the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE. The exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of other roles for which Public Health England advises use of PPE, for example, first responders and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of these groups you should refer to the advice at:  COVID-19: personal protective equipment (PPE) plan COVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings  Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra PPE to protect against COVID-19 outside clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. Unless you are in a situation where the risk of COVID-19 transmission is very high, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of PPE in providing additional protection is extremely limited.

Everyone is required to comply with these Regulations issued by the government in relation to coronavirus, in order to protect both themselves and others.

In England, Environmental Health and Trading Standards officers will monitor compliance with these regulations, with police support provided if appropriate. Businesses and venues that breach them will be subject to prohibition notices, and a person, who is 18 or over, carrying on a business in contravention of the Regulations may be issued with a fixed penalty. The government is introducing higher fines for those who do not comply, to reflect the increased risk to others of breaking the rules. With the support of the police, prohibition notices can be used to require compliance with the Regulations including requiring that an activity ceases.

{"Question":"What is being done about the EHC plans of young children?","Answer":"This group includes children and young people with an EHC plan attending all educational settings. For all children and young people with EHC plans, we are asking local authorities to follow the guidance to conduct a risk assessment - in consultation with educational settings and parents\/carers - to determine whether children and young people\u2019s needs can be met as safely or more safely in the educational environment. We are asking local authorities and educational providers to keep risk assessments under review, in case circumstances change and a different decision is more appropriate. For children and young people with an EHC plan in mainstream settings:  those in year groups specifically targeted for return should return to school, where medical advice suggests they are not clinically vulnerable to coronavirus, informed by their risk assessments, and are not shielding and protecting people defined on medical grounds as clinically extremely vulnerable those in other year groups should continue to attend or not depending on their individual risk assessments  Schools, colleges and local authorities should ensure risk assessments are kept up to date so that pupils and students can be brought back in, in any year group, where circumstances change, for example if it is becoming unsustainable for parents and carers to care for their child week-round. This includes children and young people who are placed in special units and resourced provision attached to a mainstream school, since they are recorded on the roll of the mainstream school. Schools, colleges and local authorities have latitude to use special educational needs and disability (SEND) risk assessments also for children and young people who have SEND without an EHC plan, where they feel it would be beneficial, for instance for children on SEN support who have complex needs. This means they can use this as a mechanism to bring back pupils and students with SEND who need it, in other year groups, even if they do not have an EHC plan. For all children and young people with an EHC plan in special educational settings, such as special schools, special post-16 institutions and hospital schools, settings should encourage attendance based on the child\u2019s risk assessment and on the ability of the setting to provide for their needs, and not using the child\u2019s year group as a primary deciding factor, both because all children and young people in these settings are considered vulnerable and because year groups may not be indicative of key transition points. In line with the guidance on implementing protective measures in education and childcare settings and the guidance for special schools, specialist colleges, local authorities and any other settings, special schools and special post-16 institutions should:  consult risk assessments conducted and where children and young people are attending their specialist setting, they should continue to do so work with local authorities and families to continually review risk assessments and bring children and young people back to face to face education where circumstances change, for example where it is becoming unsustainable for a family to care for a child week-round consider how to increase the numbers of children and young people accessing on-site education from the week commencing 1 June, including where appropriate by considering what the key transition points are, and ensure that as many children as can be safely catered for are able to attend their setting consider a range of options to enable as many children as possible to benefit from attending their setting, such as creating part-time attendance rotas  Hospital schools should:  aim to provide educational services for as many pupils in these settings as is possible, in line with risk assessment and social distancing guidelines and where headteachers agree with medical practitioners that it is safe and feasible to do so use their discretion in considering how to provide education services - taking into consideration issues of safety, capacity and so on - and how to prioritise pupils if this is required, including through a phased return approach work closely with hospitals and NHS trusts so that children and young people in hospital schools are able to receive their education, including through access to classrooms where appropriate  [EHC]: education, health and care   [SEND]: special educational needs and disability","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":4.0}

This includes children and young people who are placed in special units and resourced provision attached to a mainstream school, since they are recorded on the roll of the mainstream school. Schools, colleges and local authorities have latitude to use special educational needs and disability (SEND) risk assessments also for children and young people who have SEND without an EHC plan, where they feel it would be beneficial, for instance for children on SEN support who have complex needs. This means they can use this as a mechanism to bring back pupils and students with SEND who need it, in other year groups, even if they do not have an EHC plan. For all children and young people with an EHC plan in special educational settings, such as special schools, special post-16 institutions and hospital schools, settings should encourage attendance based on the child\u2019s risk assessment and on the ability of the setting to provide for their needs, and not using the child\u2019s year group as a primary deciding factor, both because all children and young people in these settings are considered vulnerable and because year groups may not be indicative of key transition points. In line with the guidance on implementing protective measures in education and childcare settings and the guidance for special schools, specialist colleges, local authorities and any other settings, special schools and special post-16 institutions should:  consult risk assessments conducted and where children and young people are attending their specialist setting, they should continue to do so work with local authorities and families to continually review risk assessments and bring children and young people back to face to face education where circumstances change, for example where it is becoming unsustainable for a family to care for a child week-round consider how to increase the numbers of children and young people accessing on-site education from the week commencing 1 June, including where appropriate by considering what the key transition points are, and ensure that as many children as can be safely catered for are able to attend their setting consider a range of options to enable as many children as possible to benefit from attending their setting, such as creating part-time attendance rotas  Hospital schools should:  aim to provide educational services for as many pupils in these settings as is possible, in line with risk assessment and social distancing guidelines and where headteachers agree with medical practitioners that it is safe and feasible to do so use their discretion in considering how to provide education services - taking into consideration issues of safety, capacity and so on - and how to prioritise pupils if this is required, including through a phased return approach work closely with hospitals and NHS trusts so that children and young people in hospital schools are able to receive their education, including through access to classrooms where appropriate  [EHC]: education, health and care   [SEND]: special educational needs and disability","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":4.0}

We recognise people who are shielding or otherwise vulnerable may also have pressing needs to move home; however, this should be balanced with the increased risks presented by coronavirus. In line with government\u2019s advice, those who are shielding or otherwise clinically vulnerable should ensure they are aware of the medical advice, including on staying at home and avoiding unnecessary contacts over this period, if at all possible. All parties involved in home buying and selling should prioritise agreeing amicable arrangements to change move dates for individuals in this group, or where someone in a chain is in this group. Clinically vulnerable and shielded individuals (ie those who have received a letter advising they are in the clinically extremely vulnerable group) will need to carefully consider their personal situation and the circumstances of their own move and may wish to seek medical advice before deciding whether to commit to or go ahead with a move. Some moves are likely to be lower risk - for instance if the home is empty, all travel can take place in their own transport and they can avoid contact with others.

{"Question":"What are some ways we can protect our employees if we are offering take-away service for our restaurant?","Answer":"In this section  1.1 Managing risk 1.2 Sharing your risk assessment  Objective: That all employers carry out a COVID-19 risk assessment. Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to socially distance, where possible. The actions the HSE can take include the provision of specific advice to employers through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.

{"Question":"Is it okay to breast feed if I'm infected?","Answer":"If you are pregnant and you have either:  a high temperature or a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste  you should stay at home for 7 days. Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital without contacting them on the telephone first. You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you are staying at home. You do not need a test for coronavirus. At the present time, only people with severe symptoms who require overnight admission to hospital will be tested. You should contact your maternity unit to inform them that you have symptoms suggestive of coronavirus, particularly if you have any routine appointments in the next 7 days. Please also be alert to the other possible causes of fever in pregnancy. In particular, these include urine infections (cystitis) and waters breaking. If you have any burning or discomfort when passing urine, or any unusual vaginal discharge, or have any concerns about your baby\u2019s movements, contact your maternity provider, who will be able to provide further advice. If you are infected with coronavirus you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. If you develop more severe symptoms or your recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that you are developing a more significant chest infection that requires enhanced care. If you feel your symptoms are worsening or if you are not getting better, you are recommended to contact the NHS on 111 (or a local alternative), your maternity unit or, in an emergency 999, straightaway for further information and advice. This advice is important for all pregnant women, but particularly if you are at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell and being admitted to hospital \u2013 if you are in your third trimester, from a black or minority ethnic background, are over the age of 35, are overweight or obese, or have a pre- existing medical problem, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. If you have concerns about the wellbeing of yourself or your unborn baby during your self-isolation period, contact your midwife or, out-of-hours, your maternity team. They will provide further advice, including whether you need to attend hospital.","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":1.5}

{"Question":"Is it okay to breast feed if I'm infected?","Answer":"There is currently no evidence to suggest that the virus can be transmitted through breast milk. Infection can be spread to the baby in the same way as to anyone in close contact with you. The current evidence is that children with coronavirus (COVID-19) get much less severe symptoms than adults. The benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breast milk or by being in close contact; however, this will be an individual decision and can be discussed with your midwife, health visitor or GP by telephone. If you or a family member are feeding with formula or expressed milk, you should sterilise the equipment carefully before each use. You should not share bottles or a breast pump with someone else.

The well-recognised benefits of breastfeeding and the protection it offers to babies outweigh any potential risks of transmission of coronavirus through breastmilk. Provided your baby is well and doesn\u2019t require care in the neonatal unit, you will stay together after you have given birth so skin-to-skin and breastfeeding can be initiated and supported if you choose. The main risk of breastfeeding is close contact between you and your baby, as if you cough or sneeze, this could contain droplets which are infected with the virus, leading to infection of the baby after birth. A discussion about the risks and benefits of breastfeeding should take place between you and your family and your maternity team. This guidance may change as knowledge evolves. When you or anyone else feeds your baby, the following precautions are recommended:  Wash your hands before touching your baby, breast pump or bottles Try to avoid coughing or sneezing on your baby while feeding at the breast Consider wearing a face mask while breastfeeding, if available Follow recommendations for pump cleaning after each use Consider asking someone who is well to feed your expressed breast milk to your baby.  If you choose to feed your baby with formula or expressed milk, it is recommend that you follow strict adherence to sterilisation guidelines.

This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas, for example, on public transport or in some shops. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the purposes of identification. Evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you. However, if you are infected but have not yet developed symptoms, it may provide some protection for others you come into close contact with. Face coverings do not replace social distancing. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, and\/or high temperature, and\/or loss of, or change in, your normal sense of smell or taste - anosmia), you and your household must isolate at home: wearing a face covering does not change this. A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment. These should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings, like those exposed to dust hazards. Face coverings should not be used by children under the age of 2 or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly. For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions. It is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off.

{"Question":"How can caregivers best support children with eating disorders during the pandemic?","Answer":"There are some key points you can consider about how to support your child or young person, including: Listen and acknowledge: Children and young people may respond to stress in different ways. Signs may be emotional (for example, they may be upset, distressed, anxious, angry or agitated), behavioural (for example, they may become more clingy or more withdrawn, or they may wet the bed), or physical (for example, they may experience stomach aches). Look out for any changes in their behaviour. Children and young people may feel less anxious if they are able to express and communicate their feelings in a safe and supportive environment. Children and young people who communicate differently to their peers may rely on you to interpret their feelings. Listen to them, acknowledge their concern and give them extra love and attention if they need it. MindEd is a free online educational resource on children and young people\u2019s mental health for all adults, which can support parents and carers through these exceptional circumstances. Provide clear information about the situation: Children and young people want to feel assured that their parents and carers can keep them safe. One of the best ways to achieve this is by talking openly about what is happening and providing honest answers to any questions they have. Explain what is being done to keep them and their loved ones safe, including any actions they can take to help, such as washing their hands more often than usual. Use words and explanations that they can understand. There are resources available to help you do this, including the Children\u2019s Commissioner\u2019s Children\u2019s Guide to Coronavirus, or the Inter- Agency Standing Committee (IASC) have produced a storybook developed by and for children around the world affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Make sure you use reliable sources of information such as GOV.UK or the NHS website \u2013 there is a lot of misleading information from other sources that can create stress for you and your family. It will not always be possible to provide answers to all the questions that children and young people may ask, or to address all their concerns, so focus on listening and acknowledging their feelings to help them feel supported. Be aware of your own reactions: Remember that children and young people often take their emotional cues from the important adults in their lives, so how you respond to the situation is very important. It is important to manage your own emotions and remain calm, listen to and acknowledge children and young people\u2019s concerns, speak kindly to them, and answer any questions they have honestly. For further information on how to look after your own mental wellbeing during the pandemic, see the guidance on how to look after your own mental health and wellbeing or visit Every Mind Matters. Connect regularly: If it is necessary for you and your children to be in different locations to normal (for example, due to staying at home in different locations or hospitalisation) make sure you still have regular and frequent contact via the phone or video calls with them. Try to help your child understand what arrangements are being made for them and why in simple terms. Support safe ways for children and young people to maintain social interaction with their friends, for example via phone or video calls. Create a new routine: Life is changing for all of us for a while. Routine gives children and young people an increased feeling of safety in the context of uncertainty, so think about how to develop a new routine, especially if they are not at school:  make a plan for the day or week that includes time for learning, playing and relaxing if they have to stay home from school, ask teachers what you can do to support continued learning at home. The Department for Education have published a list of recommended online educational resources for home schooling encourage maintaining a balance between being on and offline and discover new ideas for activities to do from home. The Children\u2019s Commissioner guide signposts to some ideas to help fight boredom children and young people ideally need to be active for 60 minutes a day, which can be more difficult when spending longer periods of time indoors. Plan time outside if you can do so safely or see Change4Life for ideas for indoor games and activities don\u2019t forget that sleep is important for mental and physical health, so try to keep to existing bedtime routines it may be tempting to give children and young people treats such as sweets or chocolate but this is not good for their health, especially as they may not be as physically active as normal. See Change4Life for ideas for healthy treats  Limit exposure to media and talk more about what they have seen and heard: Like adults, children and young people may become more distressed if they see repeated coverage about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the media. A complete news blackout is also rarely helpful as they are likely to find out from other sources, such as online or through friends. Try to avoid turning the television off or closing web pages when children or young people come into the room. This can peak their interest to find out what is happening and their imagination can take over. Instead, consider limiting the amount of exposure you and your family have to media coverage. Young people will also hear things from friends and get information from social media. Talk to them about what is happening and ask them what they have heard. Try to answer their questions honestly and reassure them appropriately.","Rating":"Acceptable","Score":3,"Average":2.5}

{"Question":"What if I'm worried about the health of my child?","Answer":"There is no evidence that women who have recently had a baby and are otherwise well are at increased risk of contracting coronavirus or of becoming seriously unwell. A recently pregnant woman\u2019s immune system is regarded as normal unless she has other forms of infection or underlying illness. You should however remain well-nourished with a balanced diet, take mild exercise as you feel fit and ensure social distancing guidance is followed. Children, including newborns, do not appear to be at high risk of becoming seriously unwell with the virus. However, close observation of hygiene, as always, is important and particularly with family members resident in the house. Anyone who enters the home should take standard hygiene precautions, including washing their hands, and be careful about handling your baby if they have symptoms of any illness including the coronavirus. It is important that your baby is feeding well and gaining weight, and if you have any concerns, please contact your midwife. Once restrictions are lifted, we would caution against large family gatherings to celebrate your baby\u2019s arrival until more is known about the spread of the virus in the community. Do not put off seeking medical advice if you have concerns about your baby\u2019s health during the pandemic. Seek medical advice if your baby has a fever, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding or any other symptoms you may have concerns about.","Rating":"Acceptable","Score":3,"Average":2.25}

{"Question":"What steps should be taken if someone in a childcare setting starts exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19?","Answer":"If anyone in an education or childcare setting becomes unwell with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature, or has a loss of, or change in, their normal sense of taste of smell (anosmia), they must be sent home and advised to follow the COVID-19: guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection guidance. If a child is awaiting collection, they should be moved, if possible, to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door, depending on the age of the child and with appropriate adult supervision if required. Ideally, a window should be opened for ventilation. If it is not possible to isolate them, move them to an area which is at least 2 metres away from other people. If they need to go to the bathroom while waiting to be collected, they should use a separate bathroom if possible. The bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected using standard cleaning products before being used by anyone else. PPE should be worn by staff caring for the child while they await collection if a distance of 2 metres cannot be maintained (such as for a very young child or a child with complex needs). In an emergency, call 999 if they are seriously ill or injured or their life is at risk. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or a hospital. If a member of staff has helped someone with symptoms, they do not need to go home unless they develop symptoms themselves (and in which case, a test is available) or the child subsequently tests positive (see \u2018What happens if there is a confirmed case of coronavirus in a setting?\u2019 below). They should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell. Cleaning the affected area with normal household disinfectant after someone with symptoms has left will reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people.

{"Question":"What steps should be taken if someone in a childcare setting starts exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19?","Answer":"When a child, young person or staff member develops symptoms compatible with coronavirus, they should be sent home and advised to self-isolate for 7 days. Their fellow household members should self-isolate for 14 days. All staff and students who are attending an education or childcare setting will have access to a test if they display symptoms of coronavirus, and are encouraged to get tested in this scenario. Where the child, young person or staff member tests negative, they can return to their setting and the fellow household members can end their self- isolation. Where the child, young person or staff member tests positive, the rest of their class or group within their childcare or education setting should be sent home and advised to self-isolate for 14 days. The other household members of that wider class or group do not need to self-isolate unless the child, young person or staff member they live with in that group subsequently develops symptoms. As part of the national test and trace programme, if other cases are detected within the cohort or in the wider setting, Public Health England\u2019s local health protection teams will conduct a rapid investigation and will advise schools and other settings on the most appropriate action to take. In some cases a larger number of other children, young people may be asked to self- isolate at home as a precautionary measure \u2013 perhaps the whole class, site or year group. Where settings are observing guidance on infection prevention and control, which will reduce risk of transmission, closure of the whole setting will not generally be necessary.","Rating":"Acceptable","Score":3,"Average":2.75}

{"Question":"What steps should I take to look after employees during this pandemic?","Answer":"Objective: To reduce risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures, in order of priority Employers have a duty to reduce workplace risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures. Employers must work with any other employers or contractors sharing the workplace so that everybody\u2019s health and safety is protected. In the context of COVID-19 this means working through these steps in order:   In every workplace, increasing the frequency of handwashing and surface cleaning.   Businesses and workplaces should make every reasonable effort to enable working from home as a first option. Where working from home is not possible, workplaces should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (keeping people 2m apart wherever possible).   Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.

{"Question":"What considerations should I be making while planning my trip?","Answer":"Plan your route, including any breaks, before setting out. Routes may be different as local areas make changes to enable social distancing on pavements and cycle routes. If you normally share a vehicle with people from other households for essential journeys, we recommend you find a different way to travel. For example, consider walking, cycling or using your own vehicle if you can. If you have to travel with people outside your household group, try to share the transport with the same people each time and keep to small groups of people at any one time. There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure. The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not yet developed symptoms. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas. If you can, wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isn\u2019t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and police staff for the purposes of identification. A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment. These should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings, like those exposed to dust hazards. Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by the law. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and after taking them off. Consider making a list of items to take with you.

Satellite centres NHS capability is being increased by providing test kits directly to \u2018satellite\u2019 centres at places like hospitals that have a particularly urgent or significant need. NHS facilities Testing within an NHS facility such as a hospital is available for patients and some NHS workers. Across all these testing methods, there is a network of couriers who collect the completed samples and deliver them safely to one of our laboratories. The swab samples are analysed at our labs and the result is communicated back to the individual. We aim to return test results within 48 hours of a swab being taken, or within 72 hours for a home test.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":3.75}

{"Question":"How is the government supporting school that will reopen on June 1?","Answer":"Schools, and all childcare providers, have been serving a vital role by continuing to provide care for a limited number of children - children who are vulnerable, and children whose parents are critical to the coronavirus response. We have worked closely with the sector, and will continue to do so over the coming weeks to support the wider opening of schools, colleges and childcare settings. We have published guidance on actions for education and childcare settings to prepare for wider opening from 1 June 2020, which sets out the overarching aims and principles of this next phase, including information about protective measures which will be in place. We will work with the profession to produce more detailed guidance ahead of 1 June 2020. All schools are different, and it is not possible for government to set specific national guidelines that could be universally applicable. Instead, we have created an initial planning framework to help school leaders and trusts to start to think through the steps they might need to take to enable them to open their schools for more pupils. This framework can be seen as a starting point from which schools and trusts may choose to develop their own plans, providing operational guidance to support school and trust leaders in agreeing the best approaches for their circumstances.","Rating":"Acceptable","Score":3,"Average":3.0}

{"Question":"What precautions should I take if I'm pregnant?","Answer":"If you are pregnant and you have either:  a high temperature or a new, continuous cough or a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste  you should stay at home for 7 days. Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital without contacting them on the telephone first. You do not need to contact NHS 111 to tell them you are staying at home. You do not need a test for coronavirus. At the present time, only people with severe symptoms who require overnight admission to hospital will be tested. You should contact your maternity unit to inform them that you have symptoms suggestive of coronavirus, particularly if you have any routine appointments in the next 7 days. Please also be alert to the other possible causes of fever in pregnancy. In particular, these include urine infections (cystitis) and waters breaking. If you have any burning or discomfort when passing urine, or any unusual vaginal discharge, or have any concerns about your baby\u2019s movements, contact your maternity provider, who will be able to provide further advice. If you are infected with coronavirus you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. If you develop more severe symptoms or your recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that you are developing a more significant chest infection that requires enhanced care. If you feel your symptoms are worsening or if you are not getting better, you are recommended to contact the NHS on 111 (or a local alternative), your maternity unit or, in an emergency 999, straightaway for further information and advice. This advice is important for all pregnant women, but particularly if you are at higher risk of becoming seriously unwell and being admitted to hospital \u2013 if you are in your third trimester, from a black or minority ethnic background, are over the age of 35, are overweight or obese, or have a pre- existing medical problem, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.

{"Question":"I need to fly and or take a ferry in the next few weeks. What are the guidelines with respect to doing so?","Answer":"Some routes may be busier than usual due to social distancing measures or changes to timetables and schedules. You should try to keep a short distance from others not in your household, where possible. Public Health England recommends keeping a 2 metre distance from other people. There may be situations where this is not possible. If you need to be near other people, you should avoid physical contact, try to face away from others, and keep the time you spend close to other people as short as possible. Be aware of the surfaces you touch. Be careful not to touch your face. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow when coughing or sneezing. There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure. The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not yet developed symptoms. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas. If you can, wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isn\u2019t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and police staff for the purposes of identification. A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment. These should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings, like those exposed to dust hazards. Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by the law. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and after taking them off. Follow instructions from your transport operator. This may include:  notices about which seats to use or how to queue additional screens, barriers or floor markings requests to board through different doors or to move to less busy areas  Be considerate to your fellow passengers and to transport staff:  do not congregate near entrances or exits while waiting be aware of pregnant, older, disabled people or people with prams who may require extra space or a seat during parts of their journey be aware that some individuals may have hidden disabilities ","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":1.5}

{"Question":"How should transport operators arrange locations to optimally control crowds and reduce contact between people?","Answer":" Consider whether queues can be moved to locations with more space for safe queues. Liaise as appropriate with other bodies (such as other transport operators, landlords and local authorities) to safely manage queues and any impact on public spaces. Consider how to provide passengers and services users with information on the service. If services, concourses or interchanges become too crowded, or queues become too long, operators should consider the full range of operational responses available, recognising the knock-on effects on other transport modes in making these decisions. Use social media, apps and other digital methods to alert passengers before they leave home, and to help passengers stay away or disperse until there is sufficient capacity available.

{"Question":"What are the provisions for further education providers for traineeship, the 19 to 24 adult education budget, and the 16 to 18 and 16 to 19 traineeships and programme funding?","Answer":"We currently use the profile of recruitment throughout the year to determine the lagged student numbers used in 16 to 19 allocations. For providers who recruit learners later in the year rather than purely at the beginning of the academic year, and whose enrolment of new learners in the summer term will have ceased, we will determine a way to ensure this does not have an unfairly detrimental impact on future allocations. For example, we could still apply the current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were recruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full year data from 2018\/19. Student prior attainment in English and\/or maths GCSEs Three elements within the 16 to 19 funding formula use students\u2019 prior attainment in English and\/or maths, namely:  the condition of funding disadvantage funding - block 2 level 3 programme maths and English payment  We anticipate that these will continue to be calculated as now following the alternative plans that have now been published to award grades to students in the absence of GCSE exams this summer, and so providers will still be allocated additional funding for young people with low prior attainment in GCSE English or maths. As further details are published for how the replacement for exams will work, we will consider these elements in more detail. Funding to prepare for and deliver T levels Allocations have been made to providers who will be delivering the first wave of T levels in 2020 to 2021 based on planned T level student numbers. We have already published the approach for applying a tolerance where enrolment of T level students is below the planned number. Due to the lagged student number approach, where the level of T level students recruited means the tolerance would be implemented, only the numbers above the tolerance would be converted to a full-time band 5 student. Read more about the tolerance in the How T levels will be funded in 2020 to 2021 guidance. We will monitor the suitability of this approach over the coming months as we get nearer to the introduction of T levels. Industry Placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) 2019 to 2020 The unprecedented impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) has meant that it is currently extremely difficult for providers to continue to organise and deliver industry placements through the Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF). Given these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, providers will not be penalised for missing specific CDF industry placement targets this academic year. Funding will not be clawed back if providers can demonstrate how the funding has and will continue to support your work on industry placement delivery. We want to make sure that providers are able to maximise the activity that they are able to carry out during this period to continue to support the delivery of placements, and to prepare to deliver placements in 2020 to 2021. Activities we would expect to continue to go ahead:  continuing to build relationships with employers and developing engagement strategies for different industries preparing students for placements (such as through virtual training for work programmes) ensuring alignment between curriculum planning and industry placement provision developing matching processes for when students can go on placements again  We will ask for evidence of this through the usual autumn CDF monitoring process in order to minimise reporting burdens, and we will still look to claw back funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate they have continued to support the delivery of industry placements. Providers must avoid the risk of double funding. We will seek to claw back funding should providers furlough staff involved in these activities.

{"Question":"Who do I contact about the PPN?","Answer":"To ensure service continuity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, all public sector contracting authorities have been advised by the government to support their at risk suppliers in a range of ways to ensure business and service continuity and to protect jobs. The measures set out in the PPN 02\/20, issued on 19 March 2020, are to ensure suppliers are in a position to resume normal contract delivery once the COVID-19 outbreak is over. The PPN is time- limited and applies through to 30 June 2020. The PPN is for contracted goods, services and work contracts, such as for building works, where there is a direct relationship between the contracting authority and its suppliers under a contract procured pursuant to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (or equivalent regulations). It does not apply to other funding mechanisms such as grants, or contracts supported by private income such as for transport provision. While contracting authorities have a responsibility to their own suppliers, PPN 02\/20 is advisory only, it does not bind contracting authorities to do anything other than what they feel is appropriate under these challenging and complex circumstances. *[PPN]: Procurement Policy Notice","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":2.0}

Ask your pharmacy about getting medication delivered or think about who you could ask to collect it for you. The NHS website has more information about getting prescriptions for someone else and checking if you have to pay for prescriptions. Continue to order repeat prescriptions in your usual timeframe. There is no need to order for a longer duration or larger quantities. Your GP might convert your child or young person\u2019s repeat prescription to one that is supplied under the repeat dispensing arrangements. This means you can go back to the pharmacy for a certain number of repeats without having to get a repeat prescription from the practice. Be careful about buying medication online. You should only buy from registered pharmacies. You can check if a pharmacy is registered on the General Pharmaceutical Council website. You might also want to make arrangements for your child or young person if you become unwell, for example making sure a partner, friend, family member or neighbour is aware of important information including their care plan, medications and emergency numbers. *[GP]: general practitioner","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":1.0}

{"Question":"How can offices and contact centres ensure social distancing at work?","Answer":"Objective: To maintain social distancing between individuals when they are at their workstations. For people who work in one place, workstations should allow them to maintain social distancing wherever possible. Workstations should be assigned to an individual and not shared. If they need to be shared they should be shared by the smallest possible number of people. If it is not possible to keep workstations 2m apart then businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate and if so take all mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission.

{"Question":"How can offices and contact centres ensure social distancing at work?","Answer":"Objective: To maintain social distancing between individuals when they are at their workstations. For people who work in one place, workstations should allow them to maintain social distancing wherever possible. Workstations should be assigned to an individual and not shared. If they need to be shared they should be shared by the smallest possible number of people. If it is not possible to keep workstations 2m apart then businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate and if so take all mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission.

{"Question":"How do the drivers hours rules apply to emergencies?","Answer":"Both the GB and EU drivers\u2019 hours rules automatically cease to apply in emergency situations where immediate preventative action is needed to avoid, amongst other things, danger to the life or health of people. The definition of an emergency is contained in domestic legislation (The Drivers\u2019 Hours (Goods Vehicles) (Exemptions) Regulations 1986 and the Drivers\u2019 Hours (Passenger Vehicles) (Exemptions) Regulations 1970). The department\u2019s advice about emergency situations is if your journey is necessary to enable someone to: 1) provide goods or services to protect public health, and\/or 2) meet their or others\u2019 basic needs for day to day living, and\/or 3) provide medical treatment and there is a risk of danger to the life or health of people if your journey is not carried out; then you should make use of the emergency exemption. Operators do not need to ask the department for a temporary \u2018urgent\u2019 exemption for these type of journeys. The emergency exemptions cease to apply once the situation is under control and there is no longer a need for immediate preventative action. The department would not normally expect drivers in emergencies to:  drive for more than 11 hours in one day have less than 9 hours of daily rest work for more than 7 days before the start of the regular or reduced weekly rest (if operating under the EU rules), or have less than 24 hours weekly rest  In addition, drivers operating under the EU drivers\u2019 hours rules should ensure they take a 45 minute break after 4.5 hours driving. The relevant provisions of the Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations 2005 will not apply, to the extent that they conflict with the requirements of responding to the emergency. Drivers will, however, remain subject to all other requirements of the Working Time Regulations in an emergency event. The practical implementation of any changes should be through agreement between employers, employees and (where available) driver representatives. Employers must, where possible, agree any extension of working time with employees or other workers, before that work starts. The drivers in question must note on the back of their tachograph charts or printouts the reasons why they are exceeding the normally permitted limits. This is usual practice in emergencies and is, of course, essential for enforcement purposes. Operators should maintain records of when standard drivers\u2019 hours have been deviated from, along with a justification of why this was needed. The responsibilities of operators, transport managers and the wider supply chain may be examined after the current events. It is important that on subsequent inspections and checks it can be clear that a relaxation was used appropriately, was well implemented and in a way to reduce fatigue (for example in relation to shift patterns).

The emergency exemptions cease to apply once the situation is under control and there is no longer a need for immediate preventative action. The department would not normally expect drivers in emergencies to:  drive for more than 11 hours in one day have less than 9 hours of daily rest work for more than 7 days before the start of the regular or reduced weekly rest (if operating under the EU rules), or have less than 24 hours weekly rest  In addition, drivers operating under the EU drivers\u2019 hours rules should ensure they take a 45 minute break after 4.5 hours driving. The relevant provisions of the Road Transport (Working Time) Regulations 2005 will not apply, to the extent that they conflict with the requirements of responding to the emergency. Drivers will, however, remain subject to all other requirements of the Working Time Regulations in an emergency event. The practical implementation of any changes should be through agreement between employers, employees and (where available) driver representatives. Employers must, where possible, agree any extension of working time with employees or other workers, before that work starts. The drivers in question must note on the back of their tachograph charts or printouts the reasons why they are exceeding the normally permitted limits. This is usual practice in emergencies and is, of course, essential for enforcement purposes. Operators should maintain records of when standard drivers\u2019 hours have been deviated from, along with a justification of why this was needed. The responsibilities of operators, transport managers and the wider supply chain may be examined after the current events. It is important that on subsequent inspections and checks it can be clear that a relaxation was used appropriately, was well implemented and in a way to reduce fatigue (for example in relation to shift patterns).

{"Question":"How do the drivers hours rules apply to emergencies?","Answer":"This document provides advice on the relaxation of drivers\u2019 hours rules, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. This document should be considered in conjunction with the extensive existing guidance provided on drivers\u2019 hours. The drivers\u2019 hours and working time rules are in place to protect road safety and the working conditions of drivers and to reduce the risk of drivers being involved in fatigue-related accidents. As such, any relaxation of these rules should only be considered where genuinely necessary and when other supply chain management interventions are unable to alleviate issues. The Department for Transport wishes to make clear that driver safety must not be compromised. Drivers should not be expected to drive whilst tired - employers remain responsible for the health and safety of their employees and other road users.","Rating":"Could be Improved","Score":2,"Average":2.5}

{"Question":"How should I handle PPE went in my own personal vehicle","Answer":"In this section  6.1 Face coverings  PPE protects the user against health or safety risks at work. It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory protective equipment, such as face masks. Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non- COVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so. At the start of this document we described the steps you need to take to manage COVID-19 risk in the workplace. This includes working from home and staying 2m away from each other in the workplace if at all possible.When managing the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE. The exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of other roles for which Public Health England advises use of PPE, for example, first responders and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of these groups you should refer to the advice at:  COVID-19: personal protective equipment (PPE) plan COVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings  Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra PPE to protect against COVID-19 outside clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. Unless you are in a situation where the risk of COVID-19 transmission is very high, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of PPE in providing additional protection is extremely limited. However, if your risk assessment does show that PPE is required, then you must provide this PPE free of charge to workers who need it. Any PPE provided must fit properly.

{"Question":"What guidelines are schools being given in regards to free meal as they are starting to reopen?","Answer":"As schools open more widely, and their kitchens reopen, we expect schools to make food parcels available for collection or delivery for any children that are eligible for free school meals who are staying at home. Arranging food parcels helps ensure that eligible children have access to a healthy free meal, and can also help the school to stay in contact with those families. We know that many schools have made excellent food parcel arrangements throughout this period. If your school catering service cannot provide meals or food parcels for children who are at home, you can continue to offer vouchers to families of eligible pupils. Before ordering vouchers, check which pupils are eligible and would be receiving benefits-related free school meals. We are monitoring voucher orders at school level to broadly check if they are ordering in line with our estimates of the number of eligible children, recognising that for some schools this will be lower if they are providing food parcels, or using a local arrangement. If a school\u2019s orders are higher than expected, we may speak to the school about why this has occurred and will take forward any necessary action to rectify the position. A cross check will also be done for those making a claim for free school meals funding via the financial support available for schools.

{"Question":"What guidelines are schools being given in regards to free meal as they are starting to reopen?","Answer":"We know that many schools and food providers are already finding very effective ways to ensure that eligible children already receive free healthy meals during this period. As schools prepare to open more widely, they should speak to their school catering team or provider about the best arrangements for school meals. Schools should ensure that they are supported to return to school to provide food both for those children attending school and for those remaining at home who are eligible for free school meals. We have published a planning guide for schools to help schools prepare for children returning to school. This includes suggested approaches to help school leaders in their decision making around school meals, including working out arrangements for lunch so that children do not mix with children from other groups. This could mean having several lunch sittings or serving lunch in more than one location, including if appropriate in a classroom, or asking your caterers to look at other flexible ways of giving pupils access to lunch such that it can be eaten in the small group setting (for example taking cold or \u2018packed\u2019 lunches to children in the areas they are in for the day). In addition, please speak to your catering teams and food suppliers about the most effective ways to manage the ordering and delivery of food during this period. This may include:  arranging fewer food deliveries each week compared with standard periods when the school is open to all pupils ordering longer shelf life products during this period, such as frozen foods or foods that can be safely stored at room temperature  In addition to providing meals in schools, you should consider with suppliers whether they can prepare meals or food parcels that could be collected by or delivered to families that are not in attendance. If you do provide meals or food parcels, ensure they are distributed in line with guidance on social distancing at all times.

{"Question":"What should we know about the Adult education budget (AEB) and advanced learner loads bursary contract for services during the pandemic?","Answer":"We currently use the profile of recruitment throughout the year to determine the lagged student numbers used in 16 to 19 allocations. For providers who recruit learners later in the year rather than purely at the beginning of the academic year, and whose enrolment of new learners in the summer term will have ceased, we will determine a way to ensure this does not have an unfairly detrimental impact on future allocations. For example, we could still apply the current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were recruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full year data from 2018\/19. Student prior attainment in English and\/or maths GCSEs Three elements within the 16 to 19 funding formula use students\u2019 prior attainment in English and\/or maths, namely:  the condition of funding disadvantage funding - block 2 level 3 programme maths and English payment  We anticipate that these will continue to be calculated as now following the alternative plans that have now been published to award grades to students in the absence of GCSE exams this summer, and so providers will still be allocated additional funding for young people with low prior attainment in GCSE English or maths. As further details are published for how the replacement for exams will work, we will consider these elements in more detail. Funding to prepare for and deliver T levels Allocations have been made to providers who will be delivering the first wave of T levels in 2020 to 2021 based on planned T level student numbers. We have already published the approach for applying a tolerance where enrolment of T level students is below the planned number. Due to the lagged student number approach, where the level of T level students recruited means the tolerance would be implemented, only the numbers above the tolerance would be converted to a full-time band 5 student. Read more about the tolerance in the How T levels will be funded in 2020 to 2021 guidance. We will monitor the suitability of this approach over the coming months as we get nearer to the introduction of T levels. Industry Placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) 2019 to 2020 The unprecedented impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) has meant that it is currently extremely difficult for providers to continue to organise and deliver industry placements through the Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF). Given these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, providers will not be penalised for missing specific CDF industry placement targets this academic year. Funding will not be clawed back if providers can demonstrate how the funding has and will continue to support your work on industry placement delivery. We want to make sure that providers are able to maximise the activity that they are able to carry out during this period to continue to support the delivery of placements, and to prepare to deliver placements in 2020 to 2021. Activities we would expect to continue to go ahead:  continuing to build relationships with employers and developing engagement strategies for different industries preparing students for placements (such as through virtual training for work programmes) ensuring alignment between curriculum planning and industry placement provision developing matching processes for when students can go on placements again  We will ask for evidence of this through the usual autumn CDF monitoring process in order to minimise reporting burdens, and we will still look to claw back funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate they have continued to support the delivery of industry placements. Providers must avoid the risk of double funding. We will seek to claw back funding should providers furlough staff involved in these activities. Free meals in further education We expect further education institutions to continue to support students who are eligible for, and usually receive, free meals in further education, or are newly eligible, whether they are continuing to attend the provider or are studying remotely due to coronavirus (COVID-19) related issues.

{"Question":"What should we know about the Adult education budget (AEB) and advanced learner loads bursary contract for services during the pandemic?","Answer":"We currently use the profile of recruitment throughout the year to determine the lagged student numbers used in 16 to 19 allocations. For providers who recruit learners later in the year rather than purely at the beginning of the academic year, and whose enrolment of new learners in the summer term will have ceased, we will determine a way to ensure this does not have an unfairly detrimental impact on future allocations. For example, we could still apply the current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were recruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full year data from 2018\/19.

{"Question":"What educational facilities can apply for CJRS help?","Answer":"The DfE has chosen to take a 5-stage approach to evaluate its own suppliers who fall within the scope of PPN 02\/20. This approach, which reflects the complexity and scale of the DfE\u2019s commercial arrangements, is intended to provide you with some overarching guidance and principles as to how you could choose to implement the PPN.  stage 1: Assessment of whether the supplier has considered other measures announced by the government: This involves asking if they have explored and applied for, as applicable, all other forms of support available to them, including the wider government business support schemes. This is to avoid duplication of funding, such as providing both supplier relief under PPN 02\/20 and payment of related workers that have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) stage 2: Assessment of whether they are a critical supplier to your organisation: The main consideration here is whether you feel the supplier provides services, goods or works that are critical in the medium and long term, and are important to business continuity to provide relief against the contract stage 3: Assessment of whether the supplier is financially \u2018at risk\u2019 as a result of COVID-19: In principle, a supplier is deemed at risk where they are unable to fulfil the contractual obligations of a contract due to COVID-19 and are experiencing financial difficulties as a result stage 4: Commercial interventions to manage supplier: It is important that commercial judgement is used when considering the type of support available pursuant to the PPN, which could include:  payments for previously anticipated volumes (even if not met), or for the advanced order of materials where appropriate continuing to pay for services to suppliers who give their best endeavours to continue delivery despite performance being somewhat affected considering an extension of time for contract performance (for example, revised milestones or delivery dates) adjusting agreed lead times which despite best endeavours might not be met by suppliers and ensure their payments are not negatively affected by that consider supplementing service delivery through your own resources, though this is likely to be difficult, but may help alleviate the challenges the supplier is suffering as a result of COVID-19   stage 5: Financial interventions: As with the commercial interventions, financial judgement should be used when considering any of the suggested options below:  variation of payment mechanism - specifically beneficial where contracts are based upon the delivery of outcomes or outputs, you can vary the payment mechanisms to provide greater short term cash flow to the supplier, for example, moving from payments on delivery of services, works or goods to aligning payments to the costs being incurred by the supplier, or breaking down milestone payments into multiple smaller payments increasing speed of payment - this PPN seeks to expedite this process and adjust normal financial controls, such as paying reconciled invoices before their due date prepayment of up to 25% of contract value - this specifically targets immediate cash flow issues, but potentially creates a cash flow issue at a later date in the contract, so should be considered accordingly.

{"Question":"What educational facilities can apply for CJRS help?","Answer":"The DfE has chosen to take a 5-stage approach to evaluate its own suppliers who fall within the scope of PPN 02\/20. This approach, which reflects the complexity and scale of the DfE\u2019s commercial arrangements, is intended to provide you with some overarching guidance and principles as to how you could choose to implement the PPN.  stage 1: Assessment of whether the supplier has considered other measures announced by the government: This involves asking if they have explored and applied for, as applicable, all other forms of support available to them, including the wider government business support schemes. This is to avoid duplication of funding, such as providing both supplier relief under PPN 02\/20 and payment of related workers that have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) stage 2: Assessment of whether they are a critical supplier to your organisation: The main consideration here is whether you feel the supplier provides services, goods or works that are critical in the medium and long term, and are important to business continuity to provide relief against the contract stage 3: Assessment of whether the supplier is financially \u2018at risk\u2019 as a result of COVID-19: In principle, a supplier is deemed at risk where they are unable to fulfil the contractual obligations of a contract due to COVID-19 and are experiencing financial difficulties as a result stage 4: Commercial interventions to manage supplier: It is important that commercial judgement is used when considering the type of support available pursuant to the PPN, which could include:  payments for previously anticipated volumes (even if not met), or for the advanced order of materials where appropriate continuing to pay for services to suppliers who give their best endeavours to continue delivery despite performance being somewhat affected considering an extension of time for contract performance (for example, revised milestones or delivery dates) adjusting agreed lead times which despite best endeavours might not be met by suppliers and ensure their payments are not negatively affected by that consider supplementing service delivery through your own resources, though this is likely to be difficult, but may help alleviate the challenges the supplier is suffering as a result of COVID-19   stage 5: Financial interventions: As with the commercial interventions, financial judgement should be used when considering any of the suggested options below:  variation of payment mechanism - specifically beneficial where contracts are based upon the delivery of outcomes or outputs, you can vary the payment mechanisms to provide greater short term cash flow to the supplier, for example, moving from payments on delivery of services, works or goods to aligning payments to the costs being incurred by the supplier, or breaking down milestone payments into multiple smaller payments increasing speed of payment - this PPN seeks to expedite this process and adjust normal financial controls, such as paying reconciled invoices before their due date prepayment of up to 25% of contract value - this specifically targets immediate cash flow issues, but potentially creates a cash flow issue at a later date in the contract, so should be considered accordingly. For example, releasing a proportion of retained funds on capital projects, ahead of actual defects being identified and remedied    It is important that any commercial or financial changes or variations to contracts should be agreed in accordance with the change control clauses contained in the contracts, and documented, even if this takes place retrospectively.

{"Question":"What educational facilities can apply for CJRS help?","Answer":"Where the above schemes are not appropriate, HE providers are eligible for the CJRS. HE providers should only furlough employees and seek support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme if they meet the following conditions:  the employee works in an area of business where services are temporarily not required and whose salary is not covered by public funding the employee would otherwise be made redundant or laid off the employee is not involved in delivering provision that has already been funded (where appropriate) the employee is not required to deliver provision for a child of a critical worker and\/or vulnerable child the grant from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme would not be duplicative to other public grants that the HE provider receives and would not lead to financial reserves being created  Any grant from the CJRS should not duplicate other sources of public funding where these are being maintained, such as UK home student tuition fees. However, we do recognise the complexity of HE revenue and the role that cross- subsidy plays. If it is difficult to distinguish whether staff are funded through public or commercial income for the purposes of meeting the first 3 conditions as listed above, and some staff will be funded through multiple sources, as a guiding principle, HE providers should not seek to furlough a higher proportion of their wage bill than could reasonably be considered to have been generated through commercial income, including from non-public research grants and contracts. It is likely that decisions on whether to furlough staff will need to be taken on a case by case basis. To be eligible for the CJRS, when on furlough, an employee cannot undertake work for, or on behalf of, their employer. Where research work has been paused (for example, where grant holders have requested a no-cost extension to UK Research & Innovation grants) and therefore providers are not able to receive payments towards staff costs for a period, resulting in a loss of income due to ceased or reduced delivery of research programmes, providers should consider their eligibility and apply for the wide range of financial support that HM Treasury has already announced for businesses, including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme in line with the above conditions. The DfE is considering appropriate measures to monitor the use of these schemes in order to detect any duplication of funding, and will be considering potential options to recover misused public funding as required. We will continue to engage with the sector and update this guidance, and provide further clarification as necessary.

Employers have a duty to reduce workplace risk to the lowest reasonably practicable level by taking preventative measures.

{"Question":"What do further education provider need to know about ESF easements?","Answer":"We currently use the profile of recruitment throughout the year to determine the lagged student numbers used in 16 to 19 allocations. For providers who recruit learners later in the year rather than purely at the beginning of the academic year, and whose enrolment of new learners in the summer term will have ceased, we will determine a way to ensure this does not have an unfairly detrimental impact on future allocations. For example, we could still apply the current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were recruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full year data from 2018\/19. Student prior attainment in English and\/or maths GCSEs Three elements within the 16 to 19 funding formula use students\u2019 prior attainment in English and\/or maths, namely:  the condition of funding disadvantage funding - block 2 level 3 programme maths and English payment  We anticipate that these will continue to be calculated as now following the alternative plans that have now been published to award grades to students in the absence of GCSE exams this summer, and so providers will still be allocated additional funding for young people with low prior attainment in GCSE English or maths. As further details are published for how the replacement for exams will work, we will consider these elements in more detail. Funding to prepare for and deliver T levels Allocations have been made to providers who will be delivering the first wave of T levels in 2020 to 2021 based on planned T level student numbers. We have already published the approach for applying a tolerance where enrolment of T level students is below the planned number. Due to the lagged student number approach, where the level of T level students recruited means the tolerance would be implemented, only the numbers above the tolerance would be converted to a full-time band 5 student. Read more about the tolerance in the How T levels will be funded in 2020 to 2021 guidance. We will monitor the suitability of this approach over the coming months as we get nearer to the introduction of T levels. Industry Placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) 2019 to 2020 The unprecedented impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) has meant that it is currently extremely difficult for providers to continue to organise and deliver industry placements through the Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF). Given these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, providers will not be penalised for missing specific CDF industry placement targets this academic year. Funding will not be clawed back if providers can demonstrate how the funding has and will continue to support your work on industry placement delivery. We want to make sure that providers are able to maximise the activity that they are able to carry out during this period to continue to support the delivery of placements, and to prepare to deliver placements in 2020 to 2021. Activities we would expect to continue to go ahead:  continuing to build relationships with employers and developing engagement strategies for different industries preparing students for placements (such as through virtual training for work programmes) ensuring alignment between curriculum planning and industry placement provision developing matching processes for when students can go on placements again  We will ask for evidence of this through the usual autumn CDF monitoring process in order to minimise reporting burdens, and we will still look to claw back funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate they have continued to support the delivery of industry placements. Providers must avoid the risk of double funding. We will seek to claw back funding should providers furlough staff involved in these activities. Free meals in further education We expect further education institutions to continue to support students who are eligible for, and usually receive, free meals in further education, or are newly eligible, whether they are continuing to attend the provider or are studying remotely due to coronavirus (COVID-19) related issues.

{"Question":"What do further education provider need to know about ESF easements?","Answer":"We currently use the profile of recruitment throughout the year to determine the lagged student numbers used in 16 to 19 allocations. For providers who recruit learners later in the year rather than purely at the beginning of the academic year, and whose enrolment of new learners in the summer term will have ceased, we will determine a way to ensure this does not have an unfairly detrimental impact on future allocations. For example, we could still apply the current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were recruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full year data from 2018\/19. Student prior attainment in English and\/or maths GCSEs Three elements within the 16 to 19 funding formula use students\u2019 prior attainment in English and\/or maths, namely:  the condition of funding disadvantage funding - block 2 level 3 programme maths and English payment  We anticipate that these will continue to be calculated as now following the alternative plans that have now been published to award grades to students in the absence of GCSE exams this summer, and so providers will still be allocated additional funding for young people with low prior attainment in GCSE English or maths. As further details are published for how the replacement for exams will work, we will consider these elements in more detail. Funding to prepare for and deliver T levels Allocations have been made to providers who will be delivering the first wave of T levels in 2020 to 2021 based on planned T level student numbers. We have already published the approach for applying a tolerance where enrolment of T level students is below the planned number.

{"Question":"What steps need to be completed before employees can come back to work in the lab?","Answer":"Objective: That all employers carry out a COVID-19 risk assessment. In this section  1.1 Managing risk 1.2 Sharing the results of your risk assessment  Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to socially distance, where possible. The actions the HSE can take include the provision of specific advice to employers through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.

You are free to make or accept an offer or reserve a property as normal.  There is a greater risk that parties may need to delay their move because someone is showing symptoms of coronavirus or self-isolating. Where needed your legal adviser should advise you and help make sure that any contracts or agreements are as flexible as possible to accommodate this risk. Prospective purchasers may wish to visit a property again once they have agreed a sale, for example to measure up. Where this has been agreed to, the above advice on prioritising virtual visits, hygiene measures, maintaining social distancing at all times and mitigating contact where possible should be followed. Purchasers may also want to send in tradespeople to carry out inspections. Where possible these should be scheduled with one person visiting the property at any time. No tradespeople should enter a property where a member of the household is showing symptoms of coronavirus or self-isolating. Where a tradesperson is visiting the property, the occupier should maintain social distancing, wash their hands regularly and minimise contact as far as possible, for example by staying in another room.

You are free to make or accept an offer or reserve a property as normal.  There is a greater risk that parties may need to delay their move because someone is showing symptoms of coronavirus or self-isolating. Where needed your legal adviser should advise you and help make sure that any contracts or agreements are as flexible as possible to accommodate this risk. Prospective purchasers may wish to visit a property again once they have agreed a sale, for example to measure up. Where this has been agreed to, the above advice on prioritising virtual visits, hygiene measures, maintaining social distancing at all times and mitigating contact where possible should be followed. Purchasers may also want to send in tradespeople to carry out inspections. Where possible these should be scheduled with one person visiting the property at any time. No tradespeople should enter a property where a member of the household is showing symptoms of coronavirus or self-isolating. Where a tradesperson is visiting the property, the occupier should maintain social distancing, wash their hands regularly and minimise contact as far as possible, for example by staying in another room. These visits should be carried out in line with government safer working guidance. ","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":1.0}

{"Question":"What funding options are available for children's services providers?","Answer":"Due to the variety of organisations in the education, early years and children\u2019s social care sectors and the different types of support on offer, it may be appropriate for organisations to access a mixture of different support. However, we expect that all relevant organisations should first consider any potential options to reduce their operating cost and secure commercial loans (including CBILS, CLBILS and CCFF outlined above) before seeking to access grant paying schemes like the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme or seeking specific support from the Department for Education (DfE). For organisations that are classified as public sector, and where there is continued public funding, staff that are supported by that public funding should not be furloughed. For public sector organisations where there is also private income which ceases or has reduced, it may be appropriate to furlough staff who would typically be paid from that private income, subject to the 5 conditions below. We would encourage organisations to first consider how they would be able to redeploy their existing workforce to help support the coronavirus (COVID-19) response. Educational settings that are in receipt of some public funding should only furlough employees, and therefore seek support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, if they meet the following conditions:  the employee works in an area of business where services are temporarily not required and where their salary is not covered by public funding the employee would otherwise be made redundant or laid off the employee is not involved in delivering provision that has already been funded (where appropriate) the employee is not required to deliver provision for a child of a critical worker and\/or vulnerable child the grant from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme would not lead to financial reserves being created  It is also essential that the grant from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme should not be duplicative of other public grants that your organisations may receive.

{"Question":"What are the guidelines for going back to school during the reopening period?","Answer":"From the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, we will be asking primary schools to welcome back children in nursery, Reception, year 1 and year 6, alongside priority groups. We will ask secondary schools, sixth form and further education colleges to offer some face-to-face support for year 10 and year 12 students (and equivalents) who are due to take key exams next year, alongside the full time provision they are offering to priority groups. Alternative provision settings should mirror the approach being taken for mainstream schools and also offer some face-to-face support for years 10 and 11 students (as they have no year 12). Special schools, special post-16 institutions and hospital schools will work towards a phased return of more children and young people without a focus on specific year groups. The following principles will apply to this phase of wider opening by schools:  children and young people in eligible year groups are strongly encouraged to attend (where there are no shielding concerns for the child or their household), so that they can gain the educational and wellbeing benefits of attending vulnerable children of all year groups continue to be expected to attend educational provision where it is appropriate for them to do so (for children with education health and care (EHC) plans this will be informed by a risk assessment approach)  children, young people and staff who have been classed as clinically extremely vulnerable due to pre-existing medical conditions have been advised to shield. We do not expect people in this category to be attending school or college, and they should continue to be supported to learn or work at home as much as possible. Clinically vulnerable (but not clinically extremely vulnerable) people are those considered to be at a higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. Few if any children will fall into this category, but parents should follow medical advice if their child is in this category.

{"Question":"Is it okay for everyone to return to work at a warehouse?","Answer":"In this section  5.1 Before reopening 5.2 Keeping the workplace clean 5.3 Hygiene: handwashing, sanitation facilities and toilets 5.4 Changing rooms and showers 5.5 Handling goods, merchandise and other materials, and onsite vehicles  5.1 Before reopening Objective: To make sure that any site or location that has been closed or partially operated is clean and ready to restart, including:  an assessment for all sites, or parts of sites, that have been closed, before restarting work cleaning procedures and providing hand sanitiser, before restarting work  Steps that will usually be needed:   Checking whether you need to service or adjust ventilation systems, for example, so that they do not automatically reduce ventilation levels due to lower than normal occupancy levels.   Most air conditioning systems do not need adjustment, however where systems serve multiple buildings or you are unsure, advice should be sought from your heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) engineers or advisers.   Positive pressure systems can operate as normal.   5.2 Keeping the workplace clean Objective: To keep the workplace clean and prevent transmission by touching contaminated surfaces. Steps that will usually be needed:   Frequent cleaning of work areas and equipment between uses, using your usual cleaning products.   Frequent cleaning of objects and surfaces that are touched regularly, such as door handles, pump handles and printers, and making sure there are adequate disposal arrangements.   Clearing workspaces and removing waste and belongings from the work area at the end of a shift.   If you are cleaning after a known or suspected case of COVID-19 then you refer to the guidance on cleaning in non-healthcare settings   5.3 Hygiene: handwashing, sanitation facilities and toilets Objective: To help everyone keep good hygiene through the working day. Steps that will usually be needed:   Using signs and posters to build awareness of good handwashing technique, the need to increase handwashing frequency, avoid touching your face and the need to cough or sneeze into a tissue which is binned safely, or into your arm if a tissue is not available.   Providing regular reminders and signage to maintain hygiene standards.   Providing hand sanitiser in multiple locations in addition to washrooms.   Setting clear use and cleaning guidance for toilets to ensure they are kept clean and social-distancing is achieved as much as possible.   Enhancing cleaning for busy areas.   Special care should be taken for cleaning of portable toilets.   Providing more waste facilities and more frequent rubbish collection.   Providing hand drying facilities \u2013 either paper towels or electrical driers.   5.4 Changing rooms and showers Objective: To minimise the risk of transmission in changing rooms and showers. Steps that will usually be needed:   Where shower and changing facilities are required, setting clear use and cleaning guidance for showers, lockers and changing rooms to ensure they are kept clean and clear of personal items and that social-distancing is achieved as much as possible.   Introducing enhanced cleaning of all facilities regularly during the day and at the end of the day.   5.5 Handling goods, merchandise and other materials, and onsite vehicles Objective: To reduce transmission through contact with objects that come into the workplace and vehicles at the worksite. Steps that will usually be needed:   Cleaning procedures for the parts of shared equipment you touch after each use, thinking about equipment, tools and vehicles, for example, pallet trucks and forklift trucks.   Encouraging increased handwashing and introducing more handwashing facilities for workers handling goods and merchandise or providing hand sanitiser where this is not practical.

{"Question":"What symptoms do Covid-19 and the flu have in common?","Answer":"The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.   Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre- symptomatic transmission \u2013transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms \u2013 is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.   The reproductive number \u2013 the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual \u2013 is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.   Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.   While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.   Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.   Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.","Rating":"Could be Improved","Score":2,"Average":1.5}

In addition, some people are sensitive to flickering lights and may get headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and even seizures if they spend too much time in front of a screen. Therefore it is important to replace some of the recreational screen time with non- screen activities, like listening to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity, like going for a walk or jog.

{"Question":"What should adolescents and youth do during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect themselves online?","Answer":"Since you might be spending even more time online than before, it is wise to be aware of some of the risks. First, be careful what content you share online. Risky behaviour, such as sexting or sharing of sexualized content, can expose you to risks of blackmail, harassment and humiliation. Second, spending more time online may increase the chances that you could come into contact with online predators who seek to sexually exploit young people. When in front of webcams wear appropriate clothing and do not connect with teachers or virtual classrooms from a bedroom. In addition, it\u2019s important to note that some adolescents \u2013 for example those with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 - may be at increased risk of cyberbullying and discrimination. Hurtful, discriminatory or inappropriate online contact is never okay. If in doubt, or if you feel uncomfortable or distressed about some interactions you have online, tell a parent or another trusted adult immediately.

Tests for COVID-19 are done most commonly by nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab or wash in ambulatory patients, but sputum or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage may be used in patients with severe respiratory disease. Molecular testing is the currently recommended method for the identification of infectious COVID-19 and just as for TB, serological assays are not recommended for the routine diagnosis of COVID-19. The pipeline for COVID-19 diagnostics has flourished impressively within a few months. Amongst these is the Xpert\u00ae Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridge for use on GeneXpert machines, which are machines used in TB diagnosis. WHO is currently evaluating this cartridge as well as other tests. Additional resources to roll out COVID-19 testing should be mobilized rather than relying only on existing resources that are used for TB, to ensure that the diagnostic coverage for TB is maintained as necessary.","Rating":"Could be Improved","Score":2,"Average":2.75}

{"Question":"Does TB affect covid-19 infection rates and symptoms?","Answer":"While both tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 spread by close contact between people the exact mode of transmission differs, explaining some differences in infection control measures to mitigate the two conditions.   TB bacilli remain suspended in the air in droplet nuclei for several hours after a TB patient coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings, and people who inhale them can get infected. The size of these droplet nuclei is a key factor determining their infectiousness. Their concentration decreases with ventilation and exposure to direct sunlight.   COVID-19 transmission has primarily been attributed to the direct breathing of droplets expelled by someone with COVID-19 (people may be infectious before clinical features become apparent). Droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, exhaling and speaking may land on objects and surfaces, and contacts can get infected with COVID-19 by touching them and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth . Handwashing, in addition to respiratory precautions, are thus important in the control of COVID-19.","Rating":"Acceptable","Score":3,"Average":1.75}

{"Question":"How can companies make decisions about scarce resources?","Answer":" Health care workers (caring for patients) and first responders can justifiably be prioritized when allocating some resources because of their contribution to the health and well-being of the community. Their health helps preserve the health of others. Participants of research aimed at developing vaccines, therapies or other critical resources should receive some priority in receiving those resources because they have also helped save others by their participation. This is not an absolute priority \u2013 for example, it should not take precedence over giving priority to those most at risk in the case of resources such as vaccines. While the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocating resources in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice, it is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution centre, those with access to better information, or those who are most well-off. Younger populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context. Consequently, the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccine, but perhaps may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical care resources. The allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in different principles or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective, a lottery-based allocation may be justified among those as highest risk, the old and those with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines. Maximizing utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off: centralizing the availability of resources in larger centres may extend their benefits to more people, but may exclude isolated populations and challenge our concern for those at highest risk.

{"Question":"How can I keep my cafe safe from viral contamination?","Answer":"Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.  Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.  If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.  Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves. ","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":3.0}

{"Question":"How can I keep my cafe safe from viral contamination?","Answer":"The general guidelines outlined in the General Principles of Food Hygiene for food processing and manufacture premises should be followed. If a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 is identified in a food premises then there is a requirement to completely clean the area with a neutral detergent, followed by decontamination of surfaces using a disinfectant effective against viruses. All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned, including all surfaces and objects which are visibly contaminated with body fluids\/respiratory secretions, and all potentially contaminated high-contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones. Alcohol based sanitizers\/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS). All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection. Staff engaged in environmental cleaning should wear PPE when performing cleaning activities, such as overalls or uniform, single-use plastic aprons, gloves and a face mask. Protective clothing (e.g. uniforms, overalls, etc.) should be frequently washed at 60\u00b0C or above.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":2.5}

While the evidence of benefit of using antiretrovirals to treat coronavirus infections is of very low certainty, serious side effects were rare. Among people living with HIV, the routine use of LPV\/r as treatment for HIV is associated with several side effects of moderate severity. However, as the duration of treatment in patients with coronavirus infections was generally limited to a few weeks, these occurrences can be expected to be low or less than that reported from routine use.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":3.25}

{"Question":"Which disinfectants are the most effective when cleaning surfaces in non-health care settings?","Answer":"It is important to reduce your risk when using disinfectants:  The disinfectant and its concentration should be carefully selected to avoid damaging surfaces and to avoid or minimize toxic effects on household members (or users of public spaces). Avoid combining disinfectants, such as bleach and ammonia, since mixtures can cause respiratory irritation and release potentially fatal gases. Keep children, pets and other people away during the application of the product until it is dry and there is no odour.  Open windows and use fans to ventilate. Step away from odours if they become too strong. Disinfectant solutions should always be prepared in well-ventilated areas. Wash your hands after using any disinfectant, including surface wipes.  Keep lids tightly closed when not in use. Spills and accidents are more likely to happen when containers are open.  Do not allow children to use disinfectant wipes. Keep cleaning fluids and disinfectants out of the reach of children and pets.  Throw away disposable items like gloves and masks if they are used during cleaning. Do not clean and re-use. Do not use disinfectant wipes to clean hands or as baby wipes. The minimum recommended personal protective equipment when disinfecting in non-health care settings is rubber gloves, waterproof aprons and closed shoes. Eye protection and medical masks may also be needed to protect against chemicals in use or if there is a risk of splashing.  Note: Where cleaning and disinfection are not possible on a regular basis due to resource limitations, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching the face should be the primary prevention approaches to reduce any potential transmission associated with surface contamination.","Rating":"Could be Improved","Score":2,"Average":1.5}

{"Question":"Should chloroquine hydroxychloroquine be used to treat COVID-19?","Answer":"WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and\/or prevention. Currently, there is insufficient data to assess the efficacy of either of these medicines in treating patients with COVID-19, or in preventing them from contracting the coronavirus. In the context of the COVID-19 response, hydroxychloroquine was one of the potential treatment options that was being assessed as part of the Solidarity clinical trial. However, on 25 May 2020, the WHO Director-General announced that the Executive Group of the Solidarity Trial had put a temporary pause on the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial while the safety data are reviewed. This decision follows the publication of a recent Lancet study focusing on the effects of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized; authors of the study reported a higher mortality rate among patients who received the drug. The Director-General made clear in his announcement that hydroxychloroquine continues to be a safe drug for use in patients with malaria and autoimmune diseases. For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R&D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO \u201cR&D Blueprint\u201d for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large- scale crises.

All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned, including all surfaces and objects which are visibly contaminated with body fluids\/respiratory secretions, and all potentially contaminated high-contact areas such as toilets, door handles, telephones. Alcohol based sanitizers\/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in concentrations of 70-80% with one-minute exposure time. Chlorine-based disinfectants (sodium hypochlorite) are effective for surface decontamination, as are disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS). All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection. Staff engaged in environmental cleaning should wear PPE when performing cleaning activities, such as overalls or uniform, single-use plastic aprons, gloves and a face mask.

{"Question":"What is the best way to stay safe since people can be asymptomatic?","Answer":"Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.  Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.  If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

Anyone who is sick, with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask according to WHO\u2019s recommendation on home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing, sneezing or talking can generate droplets that cause can spread the infection. These droplets can reach the face of others nearby and land on the surrounding environment.

Their health helps preserve the health of others. Participants of research aimed at developing vaccines, therapies or other critical resources should receive some priority in receiving those resources because they have also helped save others by their participation. This is not an absolute priority \u2013 for example, it should not take precedence over giving priority to those most at risk in the case of resources such as vaccines. While the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocating resources in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice, it is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution centre, those with access to better information, or those who are most well-off. Younger populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context. Consequently, the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccine, but perhaps may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical care resources. The allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in different principles or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective, a lottery-based allocation may be justified among those as highest risk, the old and those with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines. Maximizing utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off: centralizing the availability of resources in larger centres may extend their benefits to more people, but may exclude isolated populations and challenge our concern for those at highest risk.

{"Question":"What considerations should countries take which are neat to malaria elimination in the times of covid?","Answer":"In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration \u2013 which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. **** Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer possible. Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines \u2013 often at repeated intervals \u2013 regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers and communities safe.

{"Question":"Does HIV increase Covid-19 susceptibility?","Answer":"People living with HIV with advanced disease, those with low CD4 and high viral load and those who are not taking antiretroviral treatment have an increased risk of infections and related complications in general. It is unknown if the immunosuppression of HIV will put a person at greater risk for COVID-19, thus, until more is known, additional precautions for all people with advanced HIV or poorly controlled HIV, should be employed[1],[2]. __ At present there is no evidence that the risk of infection or complications of COVID-19 is different among people living with HIV who are clinically and immunologically stable on antiretroviral treatment when compared with the general population. Some people living with HIV may have known risk factors for COVID-19 complications, such as diabetes, hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases and as such may have increased risk of COVID-19 unrelated to HIV. We know that during the SARS and MERS outbreaks there were only a few case reports of mild disease among people living with HIV. To date, there is a case report of a person living with HIV who had COVID-19 and recovered[3] and a small study on risk factors and antiretrovirals used among people living with HIV with COVID-19 from China. This study reported similar rates of COVID-19 disease as compared to the entire population and increased risk with older age, but not with low CD4, high viral load level or antiretroviral regimen[4].

{"Question":"Are separate specimens necessary for covid and TB?","Answer":"While both tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 spread by close contact between people the exact mode of transmission differs, explaining some differences in infection control measures to mitigate the two conditions.   TB bacilli remain suspended in the air in droplet nuclei for several hours after a TB patient coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings, and people who inhale them can get infected. The size of these droplet nuclei is a key factor determining their infectiousness. Their concentration decreases with ventilation and exposure to direct sunlight.   COVID-19 transmission has primarily been attributed to the direct breathing of droplets expelled by someone with COVID-19 (people may be infectious before clinical features become apparent). Droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, exhaling and speaking may land on objects and surfaces, and contacts can get infected with COVID-19 by touching them and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth .

Women and their partners can choose any modern contraceptive method that is acceptable to and safe for them. The best method of contraception is the one that works well for you. There is a wide variety of modern methods, one of which may suit you best. For more information see here. Condoms, when they are used consistently and correctly, are the only method of contraception that help to prevent unintended pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. They can be used together with other methods of contraception to protect against both unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. Emergency contraceptive pills can prevent up to 95% of pregnancies when taken within 5 days after intercourse, and they can be taken by anyone with or without a health condition","Rating":"Acceptable","Score":3,"Average":3.0}

{"Question":"Are surgical masks effective against spreading COVID 19?","Answer":"Medical masks (also known as surgical masks): these are made from a minimum of three layers of synthetic nonwoven materials, and configured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle. These masks are available in different thicknesses, have various levels of fluid-resistance and two levels of filtration. These medical masks reduce the transfer of saliva or respiratory droplets from the wearer to others and to the environment. They also decrease the likelihood of potentially infectious droplets from others reaching the mouth and nose of the mask wearer. Hand hygiene should be performed before putting on a clean mask and after removing the mask. These masks should be worn tightly around the chin and top of the nose. The wearer should avoid touching the mask while it is on the face and the mask should be immediately discarded if it becomes moist. Importantly, wearing a mask must be combined with other preventive measures including performing frequent and appropriate hand hygiene and physical distancing of at least 1 metre (3 feet). Respirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators --FFR) and available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99): these are specifically designed for healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where special medical procedures are undertaken. Respirators are intended to protect the wearer when these medical procedures aerosolize smaller particles than normal droplets into the air in the health treatment area. Healthcare workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that the respirator is sealed tightly on the wearer\u2019s face and is properly fitted. Respirators with valves should not be used as the purpose of source control.","Rating":"Acceptable","Score":3,"Average":2.5}

Anyone who is sick, with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask according to WHO\u2019s recommendation on home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing, sneezing or talking can generate droplets that cause can spread the infection. These droplets can reach the face of others nearby and land on the surrounding environment.

If a sick person needs to go to a health facility they should wear a medical mask. Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19 Why? Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection.

There are numerous designs for fabric masks, but they generally cover the nose and mouth, are secured with ties or elastic loops, include multiple layers of fabric, and can sometimes be washed and re- used. The evidence about the benefits of these masks is limited. One good quality study showed that the risk of respiratory infection is increased (and not reduced) in health care workers using cotton cloth masks when compared to medical masks. Cloth masks are currently being recommended by some countries as a means of source control in the general population.

However, sporting organizations may have criteria for participation that are stricter than government requirements for Ports of Entry into the country that are based on event risk assessment, including organizers' healthcare capacity. Any additional screening questionnaires for participation in events need to be aligned with public health agencies in the jurisdiction. There is a need to consider how to manage different groups \u2013 athletes, officials and spectators, and the large numbers of individuals likely to arrive at a sporting event from many oversea countries \u2013 and to follow both host country and WHO travel advice and to assess whether there is difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the travel history of those individuals.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":3.0}

{"Question":"Will the pandemic make it harder for me to change my contraceptive type?","Answer":"Yes. It may be difficult however, to access all the methods of contraception that are normally available in your country due to restrictions on movement, lack of supply, as well as increased demands on health providers and services. If you have a pre-existing health condition, consult a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. Seek advice and information from your health provider and consider using methods that do not have medical restrictions like minipills, condoms, fertility awareness- based methods, diaphragm, spermicides or lactational amenorrhea if you are exclusively breastfeeding.","Rating":"Excellent","Score":4,"Average":3.0}

{"Question":"How many countries with malaria cases have also had cases of COVID 19?","Answer":"All of the considerations described above apply to malaria-eliminating countries and those preventing re-establishment of the disease: efforts must be sustained to prevent, detect and treat malaria cases while preventing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of those who deliver the services. Countries that are nearing malaria elimination must protect their important gains and avoid malaria resurgences. Countries that have eliminated malaria must remain vigilant for any imported cases of malaria that may be occurring to prevent reintroduction of the disease.","Rating":"Bad","Score":1,"Average":1.5}

{"Question":"How many countries with malaria cases have also had cases of COVID 19?","Answer":"The WHO Global Malaria Programme is leading a cross-partner effort to mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus in malaria-affected countries and, where possible, contribute towards a successful COVID-19 response. The work is being carried out in close collaboration with colleagues based at WHO headquarters, regional offices and country level. In March 2020, before the pandemic had secured a strong footing in Africa, WHO sounded an urgent call for maintaining core malaria prevention and treatment services while protecting health workers and communities against COVID-19 transmission. The findings of a modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published in April, reinforced the WHO call for continuity of malaria services during then pandemic. In collaboration with partners, WHO developed technical guidance for countries on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment in COVID-19 settings. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response  is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic.","Rating":"Could be Improved","Score":2,"Average":2.5}
