Under these temporary measures, current approved employers may wish to employ Seasonal Worker Programme or Pacific Labour Scheme participants who have finished employment with their current approved employer, but who are unable to return to their home country. Approved employers, like any employer, may also wish to employ Temporary Activity (subclass 408) Australian Government Endorsed Event (AGEE) stream visa holders  This visa will have a nil visa application charge (VAC) for the COVID-19 pandemic event.  Employer sponsorship arrangements similar to the Seasonal Worker Programme will also apply to the subclass 408 visa.  These temporary measures are not intended to prevent the recruitment of Australians to undertake this work. Before seeking access to seasonal workers under the Seasonal Worker Programme, approved employers must first try to recruit Australians. Where Australian workers are unavailable, employers can also seek seasonal labour through the Working Holiday Maker program. Working Holiday Makers who are working in critical sectors (i.e. agriculture, food processing, health care, aged care, disability care or child care) will be exempt from the six month work limitation with one employer and eligible for a Temporary Activity (subclass 408) visa in the Australian Government Endorsed Event (AGEE) stream. Employers are still required to abide by all relevant Australian workplace laws. Overseas workers have the same rights under Australian workplace law as all other employees. These temporary measures will be in place for a timeframe that allows relevant critical industries to bridge the gap between their immediate needs and the time to recruit, train and on-board Australians.

Note: where a service charged fees for only part of the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, or in the school holidays between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019, an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment will be made in accordance with these rules.  For example  An OSHC service that operates in New South Wales provides only vacation care. Therefore, their reference period is 30 September 2019 to 13 October 2019.  For example  An OSHC service provides both vacation care and before and after school care. Their reference period is from 17 February 2020 to 1 March 2020.  For example  An OSHC service operating in New South Wales providing only vacation care, charged fees for one week in the school holiday period between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019. However, the reference fortnight for the service does not change, meaning that the base weekly amount for the provider of the service that is calculated under the Rules, would be effectively half of the amount it would be if the service had operated for the full reference fortnight, instead of only one week. However, the provider of the service will receive an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment to adjust for the week.  The payment amount will be determined based on the total fees charged by the service during a reference fortnight and the reference hourly fee (up to hourly rate cap) for a session of care. For example On the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a Centre Based Day Care service (CBDC) had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care for the fortnight (or five per week) and were charged $100 for a 10 hour session (meaning the hourly fee was $10). This example assumes that all of the children were charged the same amount for the same session lengths. For that fortnight, the service\u2019s total fees charged were $20,000 (or $10,000 per week). The payment this service will receive is worked out below:  the service\u2019s hourly reference fee is $10 (because it is lower than the CBDC hourly rate cap) $10 hourly fee x 50 per cent = $5 paid per hour $5 x 10 hour session = $50 paid per session $50 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,000 paid per week.  For example: On the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a CBDC service had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care per fortnight (or five per week) and was charged $130 for a 10 hour session (meaning the hourly fee was $13). This example assumes that all of the children were charged the same amount for the same session lengths. For that fortnight, the service\u2019s total fees charged were $26,000 (or $13,000 per week). The payment is worked out below:  the service\u2019s hourly reference fee is $11.98 (because their hourly fee is above the CBDC hourly rate cap at $13) $11.98 x 50 per cent = $5.99 paid in business continuity per hour $5.99 x 10 hour session = $59.90 paid in business continuity per session $59.90 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,990 paid to the service per week.

The reference hourly fee for a session is 50 per cent of the lower of:  the hourly fee for the session; or the relevant Child Care Subsidy hourly rate cap.  For example:  a CBDC service charges $100 for a 10 hour session of care. Therefore, their hourly fee is $10 per hour ($100 \u00f7 10 = $10) The CBDC hourly rate cap is $11.98 The reference hourly fee is the hourly fee ($10) because it is lower 50 per cent of the hourly session fee is $5 ($10 x 50 per cent = $5).  For example:  a CBDC service charges $130 for a 10 hour session of care.

Maximum total size of loans of $250,000 per borrower. Loans will be up to three years, with an initial six month repayment holiday. Unsecured finance, meaning that borrowers will not have to provide an asset as security for the loan.  The decision on whether to extend credit, and management of the loan, will remain with the lender. However, the Government expects that lenders will look through the cycle to sensibly take into account the uncertainty of the current economic conditions when determining whether credit should be extended. As part of the loan products available, the Government will encourage lenders to provide facilities to SMEs that only have to be drawn if needed by the SME. This will mean that the SME would only incur interest on the amount they draw down. If they do not draw down any funds from the facility, no interest will be charged, but they will retain the flexibility to draw down funds should the need arise. SMEs interested in the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme should approach their financial institution for more information. The Government is working with banks and other eligible lenders to ensure loans are available as soon as possible. While the scheme officially commences from April 2020, your bank or other lenders may be able to provide credit sooner, and still benefit from the guarantee.

Testing diagnoses patients with COVID-19 and also helps health authorities monitor and track the spread of COVID-19. People with mild symptoms can still spread the virus. To help stop the resurgence and spread of COVID-19, anyone with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection should get tested. The symptoms include:  fever respiratory symptoms  coughing sore throat shortness of breath    If you have one or more of these symptoms, even mildly, it is important you get tested as soon as possible. Early diagnosis means you can take steps to avoid spreading the virus to someone else. If you have other symptoms that may occur with COVID-19 you should seek advice from your doctor or from healthdirect about whether you should get tested.

Where a service charged fees for only one week of care during the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, or in the school holidays between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019, the amount will be calculated on the week in which care occurred and the amount doubled.  Example A Centre Based Day Care (CBDC) service charges $100 for a 10 hour session of care. Therefore, their hourly fee is $10 per hour ($100 \u00f7 10 = $10). As $10 is less than the CBDC hourly rate cap of $11.98, $10 is the amount used. On the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, the CBDC service had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care for the fortnight (or five per week) and were charged $100 for a ten hour session (meaning the hourly fee was $10). For that fortnight, the service\u2019s total fees charged were $20,000 (or $10,000 per week).

If the test comes back negative, then all of those patients can be cleared with one test. If the test comes back positive, then all of those specimens need to be extracted and re-tested individually. The lower the prevalence of the disease, the larger the optimal pool size can be. A recent studyexternal icon from the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory found that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 reliably return a positive result when one positive sample is mixed with four negatives. Researchers in Germany and Israel have had similar results. A pooling strategy is not efficient when the prevalence of COVID-19 is high. People with symptoms and people who have been exposed to someone with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should still be tested individually. Before using a pooling strategy, the laboratory must have the proper regulatory approvals.

To protect patients and co-workers, HCP should wear a facemask at all times while they are in a healthcare facility (i.e., practice source control). Use of a facemask, instead of a cloth face covering, is recommended for HCP, because a facemask offers both source control and protection from exposure to splashes and sprays of infectious material from others.

Why COVID-NET Data Is Important COVID-NET is CDC\u2019s source for important data on hospitalization rates associated with COVID-19. Hospitalization rates are updated weekly. COVID-NET also provides important clinical information on COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, including age group, sex, race/ethnicity and underlying health conditions. Hospitalization Rates Patient Characteristics COVID-NET Data Collection, Timeliness and Interpretation Cases are identified in COVID-NET if they test positive for SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 disease) through a test ordered by a health care professional and are hospitalized within 14 days of the positive test. Clinical data are collected using a standardized case reporting form by trained surveillance officers, so the data are collected in a standardized and uniform way. COVID-NET is expected to collect the following data for each case:  age sex surveillance site date of hospital admission evidence of positive SARS-CoV-2 test demographic information (e.g., race, ethnicity) clinical (medical) history (underlying health conditions) clinical course (progression of the illness such as admission to an intensive care unit) medical interventions (medical care for the illness such as need for mechanical ventilation) outcomes (e.g., released from the hospital, death)  How COVID-NET Hospitalization Data Is Different from Hospitalizations Reported in National and State Case Counts COVID-NET differs from hospitalizations reported in national and state case counts in two ways. First, state and national COVID-19 case reporting are based on all people who test positive for COVID-19 in the United States. COVID-NET is limited to COVID-19-associated hospitalizations captured in the COVID-NET surveillance area. Second, COVID-NET reports rates and not just counts. These rates show how many people are hospitalized with COVID-19 in the surveillance area, compared to the entire number of people residing in that area. How COVID-NET Calculates Hospitalization Rates Hospitalization rates are calculated by the number of residents of a defined area who are hospitalized with a positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test divided by the total population within that defined area. COVID-NET coverage COVID-NET comprises 99 counties in the 14 states participating in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) and the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP). Participating states include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah. COVID-NET covers approximately 10 percent of the U.S. population. The counties covered are located in all 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions. The designated COVID-NET surveillance area is generally similar to the U.S. population by demographics; however, the information might not be generalizable to the entire country. Accessing COVID-NET Data COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates are reported to CDC on a weekly basis. COVID-NET data, including hospitalization rates for different age groups and data on patient characteristics, are available on COVIDView  COVID-NET hospitalization data are preliminary and may change as more data is received. In particular, case counts and rates for recent hospital admissions are subject to lag. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly.

To identify appropriate activities, all parts of a community that might be impacted need to be considered, including populations most vulnerable to severe illness, and those who might be more impacted socially or economically. When selecting mitigation activities, states and communities need to consider the spread of disease locally, characteristics of the people who live in the community (for example, age groups, languages spoken, overall health status), and the kind of public health resources and healthcare systems (like hospitals) that are available in the community. State and local officials may need to adjust community mitigation activities and immediately take steps to scale them up or down depending on the changing local situation. Putting mitigation into practice is based on:  Emphasizing individual responsibility for taking recommended personal-level actions Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to take recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at increased risk of severe illness Focusing on settings that provide critical infrastructure or services to individuals at increased risk of severe illness Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible  *CDC cannot address the policies of any business or organization.

HCP should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented at the point of care according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities:  consider nonoperative approaches when feasible; minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible; minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures; use the extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; and implement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having HCP wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility.  If surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to all recommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19. This includes:  Using all recommended PPE: an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown.  Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field. If shortages exist, N95 or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e.g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract).   As part of routine practice, HCP should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e.g., smoke evacuation devices).  Because COVID-19 can be transmitted asymptomatically, some infected individuals will not be identified based on clinical signs and symptoms. HCP providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having COVID-19 should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for universal eye protection and respirator use (see FAQ addressing recommended PPE when caring for asymptomatic patients who are not suspected to have COVID-19).

In many ways, fire camps are like small communities. For example, fire camps employ a number of support personnel, some of whom may be considered at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g., people 65 years and older, or people with serious underlying medical conditions). Also, fire camps have many people coming and going throughout the day. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken. Note: Many of the recommendations in CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Guidance for Shared or Congregate Housing also apply to fire camps. The following are protective measures that can be employed within the fire camp to prevent COVID-19 transmission:  Screening of temperature and symptoms for everyone entering a fire camp and daily screening for those who remain at the camp Encouraging personnel to maintain social distancing (6 feet or more) as much as feasible Wearing cloth face coverings as a form of source control Providing hand washing stations (soap and water) or hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol throughout the camp, especially outside bathrooms, portable toilets, and dining facilities Providing individual bottles of hand sanitizer for all personnel at the fire camp Ensuring bathrooms, portable toilets, and handwash stations are well stocked with hygiene products (e.g., soap and water, hand sanitizer, paper towels) Using disinfectants approved by the EPA for use against COVID-19external icon to clean showers, bathrooms, sinks, portable toilets, and handwash stations at least twice a day (in the morning and evening after heavy use) and commonly-touched surfaces in the dining facility before and after each meal.

Note: it is likely people will get sick with illnesses other than COVID-19, but out of an abundance of caution, all illnesses should be treated as COVID-19 until medical staff determines otherwise Ensuring medical staff in the fire camp are familiar with the CDC Guidance for Healthcare Professionals, which provides information on control measures, including PPE that should be worn, when caring for individuals with known or suspected COVID-19 ", "Rating": "Excellent", "Score": 4, "Average": 4.0}, {"Question": "What is the government doing to keep cruise lines from operating during the pandemic?", "Answer": "Outbreaks of infectious diseases can happen on cruise ships because people spend time close together and with travelers from many countries. Disease can spread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer to other ships. Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between countries. For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across the globe. Because of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk of COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order for cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US travelers to defer all cruise travel. The No Sail Order is published in the Federal Register. CDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also protecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into communities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive efforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and update our recommendations as the situation evolves. What is the No Sail Order? In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of spread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide No Sail Order on March 14 to prevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC extended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other things, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent, detect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the health and safety of both passengers and crew. How long is the No Sail Order in effect? The extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:  The Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or The CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or 100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the Federal Register and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.  Why did CDC extend the No Sail Order? The No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers, cruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship passenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:  Prevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States Preserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19 Preserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources  What cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover? The No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial passenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an overnight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies to all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US jurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended operations. It does not apply to cargo ships. What does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip? Passengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line companies directly for further information. On March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health notice with a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread of COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board? We are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public has a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role to play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can practice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining them if they have been exposed to COVID-19. CDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard and as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise ships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed attestation stating that they have complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew members who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise ship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and transport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available here. Crew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions about the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their ship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or concerns with CDC by sending an email to eocevent431@cdc.gov. Cruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to sick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines should make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and other resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a plan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical care that the ship\u2019s medical facility can\u2019t provide. CDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are working with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to ensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if the ship can\u2019t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical evacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical evacuations do not require CDC approval. What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board? A small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US waters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries. CDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health departments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help remaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible. These are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and therefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports of call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included. International cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been suspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC\u2019s No Sail Order. Therefore, this chart is available for historical purposes but is no longer being updated.

Call before you take your pet to the veterinary clinic. Be sure to alert your veterinarian if your pet has trouble breathing, or if you think it is an emergency. While most pets appear to show only mild symptoms or no symptoms, we are still learning about how they are affected by the virus. Even if your pet appears to be feeling better, avoid the following activities until your veterinarian determines that it is safe for your pet to do so or your pet has met the guidance to end their isolation:  Visits to veterinary hospitals, without calling the veterinarian first Visits to human healthcare facilities or schools Visits to parks (including dog parks), markets, or other gatherings such as festivals Visits to the groomer, including mobile grooming salons Visits to pet daycares or boarding facilities Other outings such as playdates, hikes, or visiting other homes, with or without pets Using dog walkers or pet-sitters that live outside your home    Separate your pet from other people and pets in your home   Have the pet stay in a designated \u201csick room\u201d (such as a laundry room or extra bathroom) if possible, or otherwise be separated from people and other animals. This is the same way a person with COVID-19 would separate from others in their household.   Avoid contact with the pet as much as possible, including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.  If possible, provide a separate litterbox or bathroom area from other pets.  DOGS: If you have a private backyard where your dog can go to the bathroom, do not take them for walks. If you must walk your dog, limit it to bathroom breaks only, stay close to your home, and keep your pet at least 6 feet away from other pets and people. Do not let other people touch or interact with your dog. CATS: Cats should be kept inside. Do not allow cats that have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 to roam outside. CLEANING UP: There is no evidence to suggest that waste from infected pets needs any additional disinfection. Wear gloves when cleaning up after your pet, and place fecal material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before disposing. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet.   Provide bedding, bowls or containers, treats, and toys that are separate from those used by other people or animals in the household.    Disinfect bowls, toys, and other animal care items with an EPA-registered disinfectant and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Soft items like towels, blankets, and other bedding, can be safely laundered and reused. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill animal can be washed with other items.

There are several methods that employers can use to protect the employee conducting the temperature screening. The most protective methods incorporate social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others), or physical barriers to eliminate or minimize the screener\u2019s exposures due to close contact with a person who has symptoms during screening. Examples to consider that incorporate these types of controls for temperature screening include:  Reliance on Social Distancing : Ask employees to take their own temperature either before coming to the workplace or upon arrival at the workplace. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the employee and:  Ask the employee to confirm that their temperature is less than 100.4o F (38.0o C), and confirm that they are not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath. Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue. Screening staff do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if they can maintain a distance of 6 feet.   Reliance on Barrier/Partition Controls : During screening, the screener stands behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition, that can protect the screener\u2019s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced when the employee sneezes, coughs, or talks. Upon arrival, the screener should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Then:  Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue. Conduct temperature and symptom screening using this protocol:  Put on disposable gloves. Check the employee\u2019s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window. Make sure the screener\u2019s face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening. If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check. If non-contact thermometers are used, clean and disinfect them according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and facility policies. Remove and discard PPE (gloves), and wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

Provide employees with accurate information (in a language they understand) about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure.  Provide workers with basic facts. Conduct toolbox talks on all job sites to explain the protective measures in place.   Be aware that some employees may be at higher risk for severe illness, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. Implement specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact for these employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from other workers, customers, and visitors, or to telework if possible. Provide training to employees on proper handwashing practices and other routine preventative measures. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19. Provide employees with access to soap, clean running water, and materials for drying their hands, or if soap and water are not readily available provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol at stations around the establishment for use by both workers and customers.  Place handwashing stations and/or hand sanitizers in multiple locations (including in or adjacent to portable restrooms) to encourage hand hygiene.   Explore alternative ways to promote hand hygiene if there is difficulty sourcing hand sanitizer and running water is not available on site. Some examples may include:  Install temporary or mobile handwashing stations, making sure there is an adequate supply of water, soap, and single-use paper towels. Provide a large (5+ gallon) bucket with a lid and tap that can be used to provide water for handwashing. If this method is used, the water tap should be regularly cleaned and disinfected, and the contaminated wastewater must be collected and treated in accordance with local laws and environmental regulations. Provide fresh clean water daily. Depending on the size or configuration of the job site, there may need to be multiple handwashing stations available to accommodate the workforce while maintaining social distancing, and stations may need to be restocked during the course of the day to maintain adequate handwashing supplies.   Develop and implement social distancing guidance for the workplace to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between workers when possible.  Maintain a healthy work environment  Institute measures to physically separate and increase distance between employees, such as the following:  Modify work schedules to stagger work, provide alternating workdays or extra shifts to reduce the total number of workers on a job site at any given time. Restrict access to reduce the number of workers in enclosed and confined areas at one time. Confined and enclosed areas (e.g., trailers, small rooms in buildings under construction) should be identified and access should be restricted to essential personnel only. Enclosed spaces (e.g., toilets, break areas) are potential transmission areas and should be treated accordingly. Time spent in these areas should be minimized. Rearrange administrative area workstations so that workers can stay at least 6 feet away from other workers. Install shields or barriers, such as plexiglass barriers, where possible. Remove or rearrange chairs and tables or add visual cue marks in break areas to support social distancing practices between workers. Identify alternative areas to accommodate overflow volume. Disinfect break or lunchroom areas between each group using the areas. Maintain social distancing when visiting lunch trucks or construction site vendors. Limit casual (social) conversations that normally occur at work. Cancel or postpone in-person meetings/trainings whenever possible. If you must meet, spread out to a distance of 6 feet or more between attendees. Reduce the number of individuals at meetings, including worker orientations, to increase the distance between individuals.   Conduct a hazard assessment to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, for which workers may need personal protective equipment (PPE).

Employers are required to determine, select, provide, and train on correct PPE use and application for their workers\u2019 specific job duties (see 29 CFR 1926 Subpart Eexternal icon).   Place posters that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and proper hand hygiene practices at the entrance to the workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen. Provide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for employees to use. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. If the surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them prior to disinfecting. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions that are prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and that are appropriate for the surface.

Follow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.  Maintain healthy business operations  Designate a safety and health officer to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns at every jobsite. Workers should know who this person is and how to contact them. Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider\u2019s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work. Provide information on whom to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles. Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely. Achieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check each time the respirator is used. Workers must pass a fit test to confirm a proper seal before using a respirator in the workplace. When properly fitted and worn, minimal leakage occurs around edges of the respirator when the user inhales. This means almost all of the air is directed through the filter media. Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales. The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated.

Surfaces and objects in public places, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads should be cleaned and disinfected before each use.   High touch surfaces include: Tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.    Disinfect   Recommend use of EPA-registered household disinfectant . Follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many products recommend:  Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see product label). Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.    Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used if appropriate for the surface.   Check the label to see if your bleach is intended for disinfection, and ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Leave solution on the surface for at least 1 minute.  To make a bleach solution , mix:      5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water OR   4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water     Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.  Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.  Soft surfaces For soft surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes  Clean the surface using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces. Launder items (if possible) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely.

Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. Remove gloves, and wash hands right away.  Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas  Outdoor areas, like playgrounds in schools and parks generally require normal routine cleaning , but do not require disinfection. Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds- it is not an efficient use of supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID-19 to the public. High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended.   Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected. Spread of COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective.    When cleaning  Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces.  Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals.   Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash.  Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area.   Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.  Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person who is sick. Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.   Additional key times to wash hands include:  After blowing one\u2019s nose, coughing, or sneezing. After using the restroom. Before eating or preparing food. After contact with animals or pets. Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance (e.g., a child).    Additional considerations for employers  Educate workers performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick-up to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19. Provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus. Develop policies for worker protection and provide training to all cleaning staff on site prior to providing cleaning tasks.  Training should include when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of PPE.   Ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA\u2019s Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). Comply with OSHA\u2019s standards on Bloodborne Pathogens (29 CFR 1910.1030), including proper disposal of regulated waste, and PPE (29 CFR 1910.132).

Airborne transmission from person-to- person over long distances is unlikely. The amount of time that the air inside an examination room remains potentially infectious is not known and may depend on a number of factors including the size of the room, the number of air changes per hour, how long the patient was in the room, if the patient was coughing or sneezing, and if an aerosol- generating procedure was performed. Facilities will need to consider these factors when deciding when the vacated room can be entered by someone who is not wearing PPE. For a patient who was not coughing or sneezing, did not undergo an aerosol- generating procedure, and occupied the room for a short period of time (e.g., a few minutes), any risk to HCP and subsequent patients likely dissipates over a matter of minutes. However, for a patient who was coughing and remained in the room for a longer period of time or underwent an aerosol-generating procedure, the risk period is likely longer. For these higher risk scenarios, it is reasonable to apply a similar time period as that used for pathogens spread by the airborne route (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) and to restrict HCP and patients without PPE from entering the room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, \u201cstay at home orders,\u201d and limits to gatherings have affected the ability of friends and family to come together in person and grieve in typical ways. This is true regardless of whether the person\u2019s death was due to COVID-19 or some other cause. Fortunately, most people understand that hosting gatherings now could be dangerous to those who would want to participate. Family and friends are finding alternate ways to connect, support each other, and grieve after their loss. They understand the need to possibly plan for additional memorial services when COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted. Take actions to help you cope with the loss of a loved one Grief is a universal emotion, but no two people experience grief in exactly the same way. Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of grief while practicing social distancing and honoring your loved one include:  Invite people to call you, or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected. Ask family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via phone, video chat, email, text message, photo sharing apps, social media, or mailed letters. Create a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories. Coordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer from within their own households. Some cultures practice a prolonged mourning period with multiple observances, so hosting virtual events now and in-person events later may be in keeping with these practices. Seek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. People who are not part of a faith tradition or religious community can seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends. Use grief counseling services, support groups, or hotlines, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider. Read books about grief and loss. If you have children, read age-appropriate books with them and talk with them about how they are feeling. Take part in an activity that has significance to you and the loved one you have lost, such as planting flowers or a tree or preparing a favorite meal, in memory of your loved one. Review additional information from CDC on loss and grief, and ways to cope with stress and anxiety.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who died of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as people avoiding them or rejecting them. Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger toward other people. Some people may avoid contact with you, your family members, and friends when they would normally reach out to you. You can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with extended family, friends, and others in your community. Practice social distancing while making funeral arrangements  Consider having virtual or phone meetings instead of in-person meetings with funeral home staff, cemetery staff, clergy or officiants, and others to plan funeral arrangements. If you need to meet in person, follow everyday preventive actions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19, such as wearing a cloth face covering, social distancing, washing your hands often, and covering coughs and sneezes. Do not attend in-person meetings if you are sick, might have been exposed to COVID-19, or have higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.  Discuss options for making changes to traditional funeral plans  Discuss your cultural or religious traditions and the funeral wishes of the deceased, if applicable, with family members and the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiants).  Identify any potential concerns and determine options to make changes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preserve traditional practices when it is possible to safely do so, and identify whether modified or new practices could satisfy the needs and values of you and your loved one.   Consider whether it would be acceptable to hold modified funeral arrangements by limiting attendance to a small number of immediate family members and friends shortly after the time of death. Consider holding additional memorial services in the future when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive.  When you are making decisions about who should attend, consider how emotionally difficult social distancing practices might be for attendees (such as keeping at least 6 feet apart and not hugging other attendees who do not live in their household).   Ask the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiant) about resources they may be able to provide, such as:  Virtual funeral services, visitations, and memorial tributes by online video streaming or recorded video. Consider potential issues with virtual attendees\u2019 access to technology and high-speed internet, as well as how any technological difficulties during the service could impact the event.

This approach, which reflects the complexity and scale of the DfE\u2019s commercial arrangements, is intended to provide you with some overarching guidance and principles as to how you could choose to implement the PPN.  stage 1: Assessment of whether the supplier has considered other measures announced by the government: This involves asking if they have explored and applied for, as applicable, all other forms of support available to them, including the wider government business support schemes. This is to avoid duplication of funding, such as providing both supplier relief under PPN 02/20 and payment of related workers that have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) stage 2: Assessment of whether they are a critical supplier to your organisation: The main consideration here is whether you feel the supplier provides services, goods or works that are critical in the medium and long term, and are important to business continuity to provide relief against the contract stage 3: Assessment of whether the supplier is financially \u2018at risk\u2019 as a result of COVID-19: In principle, a supplier is deemed at risk where they are unable to fulfil the contractual obligations of a contract due to COVID-19 and are experiencing financial difficulties as a result stage 4: Commercial interventions to manage supplier: It is important that commercial judgement is used when considering the type of support available pursuant to the PPN, which could include:  payments for previously anticipated volumes (even if not met), or for the advanced order of materials where appropriate continuing to pay for services to suppliers who give their best endeavours to continue delivery despite performance being somewhat affected considering an extension of time for contract performance (for example, revised milestones or delivery dates) adjusting agreed lead times which despite best endeavours might not be met by suppliers and ensure their payments are not negatively affected by that consider supplementing service delivery through your own resources, though this is likely to be difficult, but may help alleviate the challenges the supplier is suffering as a result of COVID-19   stage 5: Financial interventions: As with the commercial interventions, financial judgement should be used when considering any of the suggested options below:  variation of payment mechanism - specifically beneficial where contracts are based upon the delivery of outcomes or outputs, you can vary the payment mechanisms to provide greater short term cash flow to the supplier, for example, moving from payments on delivery of services, works or goods to aligning payments to the costs being incurred by the supplier, or breaking down milestone payments into multiple smaller payments increasing speed of payment - this PPN seeks to expedite this process and adjust normal financial controls, such as paying reconciled invoices before their due date prepayment of up to 25% of contract value - this specifically targets immediate cash flow issues, but potentially creates a cash flow issue at a later date in the contract, so should be considered accordingly. For example, releasing a proportion of retained funds on capital projects, ahead of actual defects being identified and remedied    It is important that any commercial or financial changes or variations to contracts should be agreed in accordance with the change control clauses contained in the contracts, and documented, even if this takes place retrospectively.

There are a number of other important points to note when considering how best to implement PPN 02/20 for your organisation:  whatever approach you decide best meets your needs, you need to ensure you apply the necessary financial and governance controls applicable to your organisation the PPN is very clear about the importance of transparency, and suppliers agreeing to act on an open book basis and make cost data available to you during this period, so please ensure they do so where relevant keeping a record of your agreed approach and supporting rationale, along with details of any payments made, assessment of risks or contractual changes, is important to show that you have an audit trail.

Where working from home is not possible, workplaces should make every reasonable effort to comply with the social distancing guidelines set out by the government (keeping people 2m apart wherever possible).   Where the social distancing guidelines cannot be followed in full, in relation to a particular activity, businesses should consider whether that activity needs to continue for the business to operate, and, if so, take all the mitigating actions possible to reduce the risk of transmission between their staff.   Further mitigating actions include:      \u2013 increasing the frequency of hand washing and surface cleaning \u2013 keeping the activity time involved as short as possible \u2013 using screens or barriers to separate people from each other \u2013 using back-to-back or side-to-side working (rather than face-to-face) whenever possible \u2013 reducing the number of people each person has contact with by using \u2018fixed teams or partnering\u2019 (so each person works with only a few others)  Finally, if people must work face-to-face for a sustained period with more than a small group of fixed partners, then you will need to assess whether the activity can safely go ahead.

Around one in four women in the UK has a caesarean birth. A caesarean may be recommended as a planned (elective) procedure for medical reasons or as an emergency \u2013 for example, if doctors and midwives are concerned that your baby is not coping with labour and needs to be born immediately. Furthermore, around one in five women in the UK has an instrumental birth (ventouse or forceps). Some of these types of birth may also be recommended to occur in an operating theatre in order to allow the maternity team to modify plans and undertake a caesarean birth if necessary. Most caesareans and instrumental births in theatre are carried out under spinal or epidural anaesthetic, which means you\u2019ll be awake, but the lower part of your body is numb and you cannot feel any pain. In this situation, everything will be done by the clinical staff \u2013 midwives, obstetricians and anaesthetists \u2013 to keep your birth partner with you. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, staff in the operating theatre will be wearing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of infection, which will make it more difficult for them to communicate. To enable the clinicians to assist in the birth of your baby safely, it\u2019s really important your birth partner follows the instructions from the maternity team carefully and quickly. Occasionally, a general anaesthetic (where you\u2019re put to sleep) may be used, particularly if your baby needs to be born urgently. During this type of caesarean birth, even under more usual circumstances, for safety reasons it is not possible for the birth partner to be present during the birth. While the maternity team will do all they can to ensure that your birth partner is present for the birth, there will be some occasions when there is a need for an urgent emergency birth with epidural or spinal anaesthetic, and it will not be possible for your birth partner to be present. This is because, during an emergency, operating theatres are more high-risk environments in terms of potential spread of coronavirus to everyone who is present.

There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure.

This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas. If you can, wear a face covering in an enclosed space where social distancing isn\u2019t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet.

Clinically extremely vulnerable individuals have been strongly advised not to work outside the home. Clinically vulnerable individuals, who are at high risk of severe illness (for example, people with some pre existing conditions), have been asked to take extra care in observing social distancing and should be helped to work from home, either in their current role or in an alternative role. If clinically vulnerable (but not extremely clinically extremely vulnerable) individuals cannot work from home, they should be offered the option of the safest available on site roles, enabling them to stay 2m away from others. If they have to spend time within 2m of others, you should carefully assess whether this involves an acceptable level of risk. As for any workplace risk you must take into account specific duties to those with protected characteristics, including, for example, expectant mothers who are, as always, entitled to suspension on full pay if suitable roles cannot be found. Particular attention should also be paid to people who live with clinically extremely vulnerable individuals.

However, we do recognise the complexity of HE revenue and the role that cross- subsidy plays. If it is difficult to distinguish whether staff are funded through public or commercial income for the purposes of meeting the first 3 conditions as listed above, and some staff will be funded through multiple sources, as a guiding principle, HE providers should not seek to furlough a higher proportion of their wage bill than could reasonably be considered to have been generated through commercial income, including from non-public research grants and contracts. It is likely that decisions on whether to furlough staff will need to be taken on a case by case basis. To be eligible for the CJRS, when on furlough, an employee cannot undertake work for, or on behalf of, their employer. Where research work has been paused (for example, where grant holders have requested a no-cost extension to UK Research & Innovation grants) and therefore providers are not able to receive payments towards staff costs for a period, resulting in a loss of income due to ceased or reduced delivery of research programmes, providers should consider their eligibility and apply for the wide range of financial support that HM Treasury has already announced for businesses, including the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme in line with the above conditions. The DfE is considering appropriate measures to monitor the use of these schemes in order to detect any duplication of funding, and will be considering potential options to recover misused public funding as required.

From the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, FE providers should offer some face to face contact for 16 to 19 learners on the first year of two-year programmes (e.g. a two year vocational course, equivalent to year 12 in schools), alongside the provision they are offering to priority groups. This will primarily impact schools and colleges, but will also include a small number of Local Authority providers, specialist post-16 institutions and independent training providers. We understand that there may need to be some flexibility in place due to the variety of learners and courses offered in FE settings, therefore:  although the main face to face contact is for 16 to 19 learners, there may be some courses that include learners within a class that are over 19 some 16 to 19-year-olds will have been due to finish this academic year, but not been able to because their assessments have been deferred (typically where they involve a license to practice). These learners can be included in on-site delivery if they would benefit from face to face contact; we will be expecting colleges and providers to treat 16 to 19-year-old apprentices consistently with other learners for their off the job training where possible and appropriate, so that they can be offered some face to face contact; in addition to colleges, this guidance also applies to the smaller proportion of 16 to 19 learners in other further education settings \u2013 including Local Authority delivery, Special Post-16 Designated Institutions and independent providers  In order to determine what level of attendance is appropriate within any of the options stated above, colleges and other providers should conduct risk assessments in order to understand:  the number of learners and staff likely to be included in a learning space whether they can be safely accommodated in accordance with guidance to implement protective measures the availability of teaching and non-teaching staff and required ratios, including contingency plans should individuals be shielding or self-isolating supporting services required in increasing the number of individuals on-site (for example, catering) and how they can be safely provided what measures in addition to those that have already been undertaken during the current lockdown will need to be in place to accommodate additional numbers (including additional cleaning required of spaces and equipment following use)  Learners will need to stay within their new class/group wherever possible and we will ask settings to implement a range of protective measures including increased cleaning, reducing \u2018pinch points\u2019 (such as at the start and end of day), and utilising outdoor space. Any additional costs arising from wider opening, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) will be funded from existing college budgets. Staff and learners will be eligible for testing if they become ill with coronavirus symptoms, as will members of their households. A negative test will enable learners and staff to get back to their education. A positive test will ensure rapid action to protect their classmates and staff in their setting. Those who are clinically vulnerable, or are living with someone who is, should follow our protective measures guidance. In line with implementing protective measures and reducing contacts, colleges and other providers should limit the attendance of learners in the setting at any one time and keep learners in small groups. They should also consider ways to minimise use of public transport to get to and from the FE provider at peak times in consultation with local authorities. We will be consulting with sector representatives in order to develop some \u2018models\u2019 of how this could operate, and this will be published along with further guidance for secondary schools and colleges and other providers in the week commencing 18 May. The Department\u2019s guidance on implementing protective measures in education and childcare settings contains detailed advice on:  cleaning, including supplies of cleaning and handwashing products testing and tracing PPE what settings should do in response to a case of coronavirus being confirmed  We recognise that for some programmes, online learning will be working effectively with a high degree of learner engagement (while some families may, for example, include family members who are shielding and therefore learners are not able to physically attend). Colleges and other providers will have flexibility to decide the appropriate mix of online and face to face content for each programme, reflecting what will maximise learner engagement as well as supporting more vulnerable learners, and enabling the provider as a whole to minimise transmission risk. For 16 to 19-year-old learners eligible to return, in balancing on-site and online delivery, colleges may consider the following issues:  Which learners are most at risk of disengagement through online learning (typically at lower academic levels). Learners that require on-site provision in order to undertake technical instruction which requires the use of equipment. The impact on the risk of transmission (for example it may be easier to undertake instruction in outside settings or larger spaces). Some types of vocational instruction may be more challenging where they by their nature involve personal contact. Where online learning is working well with high engagement, colleges may wish to maintain a larger element of online delivery. It may be advantageous to offer all learners some face to face contact, even if to varying degrees.

They are funded in 3 main ways: by grant; under a direct contract for services with ESFA; or through a funding agreement with the ESFA (where provision is delivered under a contract for services between a levy paying employer and an apprenticeships training provider, or advanced learner loan funded learning). Where the provider is continuing to receive public funding through any of these routes they should continue delivering this provision where feasible, including through remote delivery. They should not furlough staff whose salaries are paid from continuing Education and Skills Funding Agency (or any other public) income. This applies to both teaching and non-teaching staff. We recognise that many providers rely on funding from a mix of public sources and other income streams such as fees, employer contributions and commercial income. Where public income has reduced or non-public income has ceased or reduced, it may be appropriate for providers to seek support from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to furlough staff. Providers should only furlough employees if they meet the following conditions:  the employee works in an area of business where services are temporarily not required and whose salary is not covered by public funding the employee would otherwise be made redundant or laid off the employee is not involved in delivering provision that has already been funded (where appropriate) the employee is not required to deliver provision for a child of a critical worker and/or vulnerable child the grant from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme would not duplicate other public grants received and would not lead to financial reserves being created  If it is difficult to distinguish whether staff are funded through continuing public funding, for the purposes of meeting the first 3 conditions listed above, then the total proportion of teaching and non-teaching staff (based on gross payroll) that are retained (for example, not furloughed) should, as a minimum, be equivalent to the continuing public income, as a proportion of all income that the provider usually receives. For example, if the only source of public funding is through a grant, and non-grant income makes up 25% of total income, then this should be the total maximum proportion of staff (based on gross payroll) that could be furloughed. Where providers consider furloughing staff, they should ensure that they take a fair and reasonable approach to part-time, sessional and temporary staff, reflective of good HR practice and legal requirements. Where a provider receives Adult Education Budget (AEB), or apprenticeship funding, as part of a direct contract for services with ESFA, and is at risk financially, they may be eligible for support (subject to meeting additional criteria) as part of DfE\u2019s response to the Cabinet Office\u2019s Procurement Policy Note 02/20. Support provided through that mechanism would count as public funding for the purposes of conditions covering the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Further guidance on the operation of any supplier relief scheme for providers funded under a contract for services with ESFA will be published when available. Providers should email ESFA.PPN220Queries@education.gov.uk to register their interest in the scheme. In instances where public funding is not delivered under a contract for services with the ESFA, the Cabinet Officer\u2019s Procurement Policy Note 02/20 is not applicable. The DfE is considering appropriate measures to monitor use of these schemes in order to detect any duplication of funding, and will be considering potential options to recover misused public funding as required. Some providers may also be eligible for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme.

Landlords should avoid moving tenants who are showing symptoms of coronavirus or self-isolating. There may be exceptions to this (e.g. safety reasons) and in these scenarios landlords should speak to the local Public Health team about appropriate infection control measures before taking any action. Landlords should also avoid moving residents who are shielding because they have been notified they are in the clinically extremely vulnerable group.

The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact. You are very unlikely to be infected from walking past another person. Public Health England (PHE) recommends trying to keep 2 metres away from people, where possible, as a precaution. However, this is not a rule and the science is complex. The key thing is to not be too close to people for more than a short amount of time, as much as you can. Employers should advise staff and passengers on ways of working to keep their distance from other people as much as possible. There are situations where this may not be possible, for example when boarding or alighting, during security checks, on busier services, busier times of day, when walking through interchanges and when undertaking maintenance work that requires two people for the task. Where social distancing is not possible try to minimise the time spent within 2 metres of others, and keep groups of workers in teams that are as small as possible (\u201ccohorting\u201d). For example, keeping maintenance crews working together, rather than mixing crew members on different shifts. Organisations could consider:  Creating and agreeing a single, clear approach to social distancing for all workers and passengers.  Agreeing and maintaining clear rules for workers and passengers that meet social distancing guidelines, for example:  Clear rules for interacting with passengers, receiving goods, and testing equipment. Support individual workers who choose to use face coverings in situations where social distancing is not possible.  Organising the workspace and how people work in a single space to follow social distancing guidelines, such as:   Separating workspaces 2 metres apart from one another, where possible.  Use of screens or barriers. Eliminating face-to-face seating, for example, shift to \u2018bench\u2019 style. Repositioning workspaces to allow for optimal ventilation. Reducing occupancy of group interaction spaces, including spaces shared with other organisations. Adjustments for those with specific needs or protected characteristics, for example disabled people, the elderly and pregnant women. Consider groups of people who process information differently or who may not be able to distance from others.    Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect against coronavirus outside of clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case. Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non- COVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so. When managing the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE. There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure. The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not yet developed symptoms. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas. Government guidance is for passengers, if they can, to wear a face covering if they need to use public transport. A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment. These should continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings, like those exposed to dust hazards. Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by the law. If workers choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash hands before putting them on and taking them off. Use the guidance on face coverings. If workers choose to use face coverings, you should support them in using face coverings safely. For example:  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and after removing it. When wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands. Change your face covering if it becomes damp or if you\u2019ve touched it. Continue to wash your hands regularly. Change and wash your face covering daily. If the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If it\u2019s not washable, dispose of it in your usual waste. Practise social distancing wherever possible.

For providers who recruit learners later in the year rather than purely at the beginning of the academic year, and whose enrolment of new learners in the summer term will have ceased, we will determine a way to ensure this does not have an unfairly detrimental impact on future allocations. For example, we could still apply the current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were recruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full year data from 2018/19. Student prior attainment in English and/or maths GCSEs Three elements within the 16 to 19 funding formula use students\u2019 prior attainment in English and/or maths, namely:  the condition of funding disadvantage funding - block 2 level 3 programme maths and English payment  We anticipate that these will continue to be calculated as now following the alternative plans that have now been published to award grades to students in the absence of GCSE exams this summer, and so providers will still be allocated additional funding for young people with low prior attainment in GCSE English or maths. As further details are published for how the replacement for exams will work, we will consider these elements in more detail. Funding to prepare for and deliver T levels Allocations have been made to providers who will be delivering the first wave of T levels in 2020 to 2021 based on planned T level student numbers. We have already published the approach for applying a tolerance where enrolment of T level students is below the planned number. Due to the lagged student number approach, where the level of T level students recruited means the tolerance would be implemented, only the numbers above the tolerance would be converted to a full-time band 5 student.

Industry Placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) 2019 to 2020 The unprecedented impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) has meant that it is currently extremely difficult for providers to continue to organise and deliver industry placements through the Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF). Given these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, providers will not be penalised for missing specific CDF industry placement targets this academic year. Funding will not be clawed back if providers can demonstrate how the funding has and will continue to support your work on industry placement delivery. We want to make sure that providers are able to maximise the activity that they are able to carry out during this period to continue to support the delivery of placements, and to prepare to deliver placements in 2020 to 2021. Activities we would expect to continue to go ahead:  continuing to build relationships with employers and developing engagement strategies for different industries preparing students for placements (such as through virtual training for work programmes) ensuring alignment between curriculum planning and industry placement provision developing matching processes for when students can go on placements again  We will ask for evidence of this through the usual autumn CDF monitoring process in order to minimise reporting burdens, and we will still look to claw back funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate they have continued to support the delivery of industry placements.

Over time, as restrictions are lifted, providers will begin to re-introduce classroom and workshop-based learning. For many learners, this will mean a transition from remote learning to blended learning (e.g. a combination of remote and traditional classroom, workshop or workplace learning). Given resources are finite - estate, equipment and staff - the varied needs of different learner groups and courses will need to be balanced, providers will need flexibility in deciding the optimal mix of online and face to face content across their curriculum to maximise learner engagement, support vulnerable learners, and enable the provider as a whole to minimise the transmission risk. Providers will also need to take account of learners who may have family members who are shielding and therefore do not wish to physically attend. Two DfE grant funded organisations - Jisc and The Education and Training Foundation (ETF) \u2013 are well-placed to advise and support colleges and staff regarding remote teaching and learning. Support available includes free content, blogs, and community support. The ETF\u2019s Enhance Digital Learning Platform offers free training to teachers in how to use technology to support the continuity of teaching and learning. ETF is also running webinars for FE providers on how to make the most of online learning. Providers\u2019 strategies for ongoing learning should be informed by the needs of teachers and students, and their respective home teaching and learning environments. Where possible, colleges and other providers should:   Prepare staff on remote learning practice through bitesize/refresher training sessions focused on how to use college virtual learning environments (VLEs), communication tools and digital and non-digital resources.   Use tools already available at your college including physical and digital resources, and how to make use of cloud storage systems (for example, Office 365 or Google G Suite). Ensure staff and students have log-in details and know how to access online content.   Provide students with accessible guides on remote learning, focusing on where, when and how they are expected to engage and demonstrate their learning and how assessment and feedback will be delivered. Consider how to support disadvantaged learners.   Consider provision for partnership working with the relevant agencies (including Health and Social Care) to help ensure support for vulnerable children and children with special educational needs and disabilities.   Consider how you will deploy your staff to ensure safeguarding, Prevent and security policies are maintained. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) provides guidance on how to work from home while adhering to these policies.   Consider lesson capture to allow students to dip in and out of lessons at their own pace.   Be sensitive and adaptive to the wellbeing and wellness of both students and teachers, recognising that health and caring responsibilities will disrupt the teaching delivery and learning journey for individuals during the closure period. Jisc has produced a guide to the Digital Wellbeing of Learners which curates a number of resources and guides.   We understand that what providers can offer during this period will vary. Some colleges and FE providers have shifted much of their provision online and are delivering classes and other teacher led activity to a regular timetable. This is excellent practice if it can be reasonably maintained. The local ESFA teams will also provide support and you can submit enquiries through the ESFA enquiries service.

The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not developed symptoms. A face covering can be very simple and may be worn in enclosed spaces where social distancing isn\u2019t possible. It just needs to cover your mouth and nose. It is not the same as a face mask, such as the surgical masks or respirators used by health and care workers. Similarly, face coverings are not the same as the PPE used to manage risks like dust and spray in an industrial context. Supplies of PPE, including face masks, must continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards. It is important to know that the evidence of the benefit of using a face covering to protect others is weak and the effect is likely to be small, therefore face coverings are not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk, including minimising time spent in contact, using fixed teams and partnering for close-up work, and increasing hand and surface washing. These other measures remain the best ways of managing risk in the workplace and government would therefore not expect to see employers relying on face coverings as risk management for the purpose of their health and safety assessments. Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by law, including in the workplace. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off. Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely if they choose to wear one. This means telling workers:  wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and after removing it when wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands change your face covering if it becomes damp or if you\u2019ve touched it continue to wash your hands regularly change and wash your face covering daily if the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

Maintained nursery schools should refer to the early years section above. Mainstream state-funded schools Local authority maintained schools (including pupil referral units) and academies (including free schools) will continue to receive their budgets for the coming year, as usual, regardless of any periods of partial or complete closure. That will ensure that they are able to continue to pay their staff, and meet their other regular financial commitments, as we move through these extraordinary times. We know that schools may face additional costs as a result of coronavirus (COVID-19). We have put in place additional support to help schools meet these costs; guidance is available on this additional funding. We do not, in general, expect schools to furlough staff. However, we understand that, in some instances, schools may have a separate private income stream (for example, catering, sports facilities lettings, or boarding provision funded by parents in state boarding schools). Where this income has either stopped or been reduced and there are staff that are typically paid from those private income streams, it may be appropriate to furlough staff. Schools should first seek to make the necessary savings from their existing budget or consider options to redeploy these staff before furloughing them. Only after all other potential options have been fully considered should schools furlough those members of staff and seek support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. The following conditions need to be met:  the employee works in an area of business where services are temporarily not required and whose salary is not covered by public funding the employee would otherwise be made redundant or laid off \u2022 the employee is not involved in delivering provision that has already been funded (where appropriate) the employee is not required to deliver provision for a child of a critical worker and/or vulnerable child the grant from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme would not duplicate other public grants received and would not lead to financial reserves being created  Where these conditions are met, schools should receive a grant from the CJRS which is in line with the proportion of its paybill which could be considered to have been funded by a school\u2019s private income. To illustrate: If a school\u2019s average monthly private income stream (for example, from parent- paid school meals) provides 4% of the schools\u2019 overall income, the school could claim support through the CJRS for up to 4% of its paybill, after exhausting options to meet costs from existing budgets and redeployment This would be done by furloughing staff (for example, catering staff) whose usual salary or combined salaries are linked with the income lost and come to no greater than 4% of the provider\u2019s total paybill. Schools are not expected to consider each stream of private income separately so a school should consider its total income from private sources, as a proportion of its overall income, and the pay of all the staff it proposes to furlough, as a proportion of its total paybill.

Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks.

Implementation of the checklist may well have financial implications; care must be exercised to ensure these are taken into account with due regard for the impact on the college\u2019s overall budget and financial position. Regular updates should be provided to the Education and Skills Funding Agency ESFA territorial teams as appropriate.

It is recognised that many college leaders and boards have already been scenario planning for this eventuality, taking measures to risk assess and prepare in general terms, whilst awaiting further detail of proposals. This guidance aims to further assist preparations. Guidance documents that this should be read in conjunction with this are:  Safe working in education, childcare and children\u2019s social care Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak Coronavirus (COVID-19): safeguarding in schools, colleges and other providers Keeping Children Safe in Education 2019 Working Together to Safeguard Children  In addition the following documents published on 11 May provide updated information:  Press notice Actions for educational and childcare settings Implementing protective measures in education childcare settings Information for parents and carers  Further guidance will be published as appropriate.

We will ask secondary schools, sixth form and further education colleges to offer some face-to-face support for year 10 and year 12 students (and equivalents) who are due to take key exams next year, alongside the full time provision they are offering to priority groups. Alternative provision settings should mirror the approach being taken for mainstream schools and also offer some face-to-face support for years 10 and 11 students (as they have no year 12). Special schools, special post-16 institutions and hospital schools will work towards a phased return of more children and young people without a focus on specific year groups. The following principles will apply to this phase of wider opening by schools:  children and young people in eligible year groups are strongly encouraged to attend (where there are no shielding concerns for the child or their household), so that they can gain the educational and wellbeing benefits of attending vulnerable children of all year groups continue to be expected to attend educational provision where it is appropriate for them to do so (for children with education health and care (EHC) plans this will be informed by a risk assessment approach)  children, young people and staff who have been classed as clinically extremely vulnerable due to pre-existing medical conditions have been advised to shield. We do not expect people in this category to be attending school or college, and they should continue to be supported to learn or work at home as much as possible. Clinically vulnerable (but not clinically extremely vulnerable) people are those considered to be at a higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. Few if any children will fall into this category, but parents should follow medical advice if their child is in this category. Staff in this category should work from home where possible, and refer to the detail in our protective measures guidance   a child/young person or a member of staff who lives with someone who is clinically vulnerable (but not clinically extremely vulnerable), including those who are pregnant, can attend their education or childcare setting  if a child/young person or staff member lives in a household with someone who is extremely clinically vulnerable, as set out in the guidance on shielding, it is advised they only attend an education or childcare setting if stringent social distancing can be adhered to and, in the case of children, if they are able to understand and follow those instructions. This may not be possible for very young children and older children without the capacity to adhere to the instructions on social distancing.

However, we recognise that in the current circumstances some students may need more hours than originally planned in order to complete their traineeship programme. Where learners need longer than originally planned to complete their traineeship programme, we expect, in most cases, stretching their existing planned hours over a longer duration should provide the flexibility providers need. In exceptional circumstances, where a learner with part-time hours requires significant extra delivery, while they are unable to deliver work experience with an employer, providers can increase the planned hours. Providers should record where an increase of planned hours is required in the learner file and demonstrate the need for increased hours to ensure learners remain engaged. We may ask for this evidence through monitoring processes. The planned end date must not under any circumstances be changed or extended within the ILR. Providers should continue to record the end date of the programme using \u2018Learning Actual End Date\u2019.

However, the second aim was to continue to care for children whose parents are critical to the coronavirus response, so that they can continue to work where alternative childcare arrangements cannot be made, and for children who are vulnerable. Now that we have made progress in reducing the transmission of coronavirus we are encouraging all eligible children to attend \u2013 it is no longer necessary for parents of eligible children to keep them at home if they can. These priority groups remain eligible to attend as schools open to more students. In the first phases of wider opening, we will prioritise younger children, for several reasons. Firstly, because there is moderately high scientific confidence in evidence suggesting younger children are less likely to become unwell if infected with coronavirus; and secondly because evidence shows the particularly detrimental impact which time spent out of education can have upon them. The three year groups within mainstream primary have been prioritised because they are key transition years \u2013 children in Reception and year 1 are at the very beginning of their school career and are mastering the essential basics, including counting and the fundamentals of reading and writing, and learning to socialise with their peers. We know that attending early education lays the foundation for lifelong learning and supports children\u2019s social and emotional development. Year 6 children are finishing Key Stage 2 and are preparing for the transition to secondary school, and will benefit immensely from time with their friends and teachers to ensure they are ready. From 1 June, as more children return to schools, we appreciate that each setting\u2019s circumstances will be slightly different.

The government has put in place protections for tenants during the coronavirus outbreak, including legislation to delay when landlords are able to start proceedings to evict tenants. This means until 30 September 2020, most landlords will not be able to start possession proceedings unless they have given their tenants three-months\u2019 notice. This guidance for landlords and letting agents is to help them safely let empty properties, or properties which tenants are voluntarily vacating. While broader measures to protect tenants during the coronavirus outbreak remain in place, letting agents and landlords should endeavour to avoid ending tenancies where the tenant wants and is able to stay. Letting agents and landlords should be aware of and follow government guidance on coronavirus and renting, which explains these protections in greater detail, and make sure tenants are aware of this guidance.  Private landlords and letting agents should not conduct viewings in properties where tenants are symptomatic or self-isolating, or where it has been determined that they are clinically extremely vulnerable and are shielding. In other cases, where viewings can proceed, they should be conducted in line with the guidance on viewings earlier in this document. Any visits to a property must be made in accordance with government\u2019s guidelines on working in other people\u2019s homes and social distancing. If possible, necessary repairs, gas and electrical safety checks should be conducted in the period between a property being vacated and a new tenant moving in. If this is not possible and visits are needed to an occupied property, this should be done by appointment with measures put in place to ensure physical contact is minimised, for example with residents staying in another room during the visit. Landlords should make every effort to abide by gas and electrical safety requirements, which continue to be of great importance for tenants\u2019 safety. This may be more difficult due to restrictions associated with the coronavirus outbreak, for example where a tenant has coronavirus symptoms, is self-isolating or shielding. Under such circumstances, provided the landlord can demonstrate they have taken reasonable steps to comply, they would not be in breach. See further Health and Safety Executive guidance on how to deal with specific circumstances. Letting agents may also want to consider obtaining landlord and tenant consent for inventory clerk appointments to also occur before a tenant moves in or after a tenant moves out during vacant periods if possible. Letting agents and landlords should take steps to ensure any properties are prepared ready for new tenants, this may include cleaning to minimise any potential spread of the virus in line with government advice. Letting agents and landlords should consider how best to conduct tenancy check-ins for new tenancies agreed while broader measures remain in place, taking care to follow government advice on social distancing to minimise possible spread of coronavirus. Letting agents and landlords are reminded of the temporary COVID-19 measures that adjust right to rent checks, temporarily allowing these checks to be conducted remotely. Lettings agents and landlords should consider other areas where in person payments, referencing or checks can be conducted remotely instead and take further advice if required.

They will want to refocus their teaching staff to support learners to come back into the classroom where this is appropriate and sustain the online offer that they have developed to continue ongoing learning since the decision to close educational settings was taken. The current proposals mean that a relatively small proportion of learners will return to face to face learning in the first instance and online learning can continue for the majority of learners. We know that this move will cause concern for some teachers who are having to shield or who have family members that are at risk. It is essential that in all of their planning, colleges and other providers continue to implement PHE advice on supporting those who are shielding or who are at risk. Teachers who fall into these categories should continue to be supported to take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their families including remaining at home should they need to. Colleges and other providers will be planning how they can best reintroduce more learners into their premises alongside those vulnerable learners and children of key workers who are already present on site. We know that there will be aspects of provision that cause concern to teachers, for example, use of limited space in classrooms or workshops for teaching or specific assessments of learners\u2019 competence. The guidance on social distancing will help colleges and other providers to make decisions about how to deploy teachers safely on their premises and to keep them safe when they are delivering face to face teaching or undertaking assessments that require practical demonstration. We are confident that providers will be able to make this transition work for their learners and staff, so that education can continue to be delivered in the most effective and safe way. Specific guidance for educational settings on social distancing and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will continue to be updated and should be used alongside this advice. What is most important is getting the balance right between the need for learners and teachers to be present onsite and making the best use of online teaching and learning. Any additional costs arising from increasing numbers of learners will be funded from existing college budgets. Colleges and other providers will also be seeking to recruit new teachers to fill existing vacancies and support delivery in future. We know that this will be a challenge in the current circumstances, particularly as teacher recruitment often includes a demonstration of teaching in the classroom, however we are confident that providers can find ways to recruit teachers using online delivery and other assessment methods where appropriate. Providers can still register for Round 3 of the Taking Teaching Further programme which is intended to support the recruitment of industry professionals to teaching roles in the FE sector. For those seeking support to recruit English, maths or SEND teachers we are still accepting applications for In-service ITE grants of \u00a318,200, which are available directly from the department. We have also provided advice to FE Initial Teacher Education providers to mitigate the disruption to teacher training where possible and enable as many new teachers as possible to complete their training where they have demonstrated they have met the required standard.

This might include children on the edge of receiving support from children\u2019s social care services, adopted children, those at risk of becoming NEET (\u2018not in employment, education or training\u2019), those living in temporary accommodation, those who are young carers and others at the provider and local authority\u2019s discretion.  More information, including the expectations around attendance and encouraging attendance for different groups of vulnerable young people, can be found in Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. From the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, we will be asking colleges and other providers to invite increasing numbers of young people to return to on-site provision, alongside priority groups (vulnerable young people and children of critical workers). Special post-16 institutions will work towards a phased return of more young people without a focus on specific year groups. The government has set out guidance on staying alert and safe (social distancing) to help educational settings support safe provision for everyone who attends. Many colleges and other providers have already taken steps to support vulnerable young people, and the children of critical workers who cannot be supported elsewhere, and we are grateful to providers for the vital role they are playing in supporting the national response to coronavirus. Specifically, we are asking that colleges and other providers:   continue to provide a safe space and encourage attendance: Being in an educational setting can be an important lifeline for many vulnerable young people, particularly where their needs cannot be met safely at home or where they may be at risk of harm.   There is a continuing expectation now and throughout the period from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest that vulnerable young people \u2013 regardless of year group \u2013 will attend educational provision, where it is safe and appropriate for them do so.   From the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, young people in returning year groups \u2013 including vulnerable young people - are strongly encouraged to attend their educational setting where possible, unless they are ill, or guidance says they should not attend.   Providers are expected to follow the process set out on encouraging, enabling and monitoring attendance and following up on non-attendance, see Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.   We appreciate that decisions on attendance will likely be based on finely balanced discussions between the education provider, the parent/carer and others, including social workers, local authorities and other relevant professionals where applicable. The decision might be taken that the learner should attend the educational setting on a full-time or part-time basis, depending on the needs of the individual. We also appreciate that circumstances do change and therefore attendance decisions should be kept under review. For young people with an education, health and care (EHC) plan, colleges and other providers should ensure that existing risk assessments are up to date.   Where vulnerable young people are already attending educational settings, they should continue to do so. Where young people are currently not attending but attendance is appropriate, we expect providers and local authorities to consider how to encourage their attendance. If it is not possible for a vulnerable young person to attend a provider due to public transport routes being closed, then providers should speak to the local authority to consider what alternative transport arrangements could be put in place.   Make alternative arrangements: We are asking colleges and other providers that have been closed to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, so we expect the number of colleges and other providers that are closed to decline. However, in the meantime if a college or another provider is closed, the provider should notify the local authority/social worker. Providers should work with the local authority to ensure that the vulnerable young people who normally attend can be found a place in another educational setting. Providers can also contact their local ESFA team to discuss wider opening and which other local providers it may be possible for them to work with. Keep in contact with all vulnerable learners: As per the existing guidance on vulnerable children and young people, all vulnerable young people continue to be expected and encouraged to attend educational provision where it is appropriate for them to do so. Colleges and other providers which are currently closed are being asked to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest. However, where it is not safe for vulnerable learners to attend, or vulnerable learners cannot be persuaded to attend education settings, colleges and other providers should maintain regular communication with social workers, vulnerable leaners and their families to ensure they know where their vulnerable learners are and that they are safe. Colleges and other providers should continue to encourage attendance where appropriate. The frequency of contact required will depend on the individual\u2019s circumstances and needs and will be based on the assessment of risk. Social workers will remain in contact with vulnerable learners and their families, including remotely if needed.  Section 15 below is a collection of examples from providers who are successfully engaging vulnerable young people. It is intended to provide an opportunity for colleges and other providers to learn from each other\u2019s emerging practice and develop their approach to engaging vulnerable learners in education.

In this section  1.1 Managing risk 1.2 Sharing the results of your risk assessment  Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to socially distance, where possible.

Cough, fever, shortness of breath, headache and loss or change to your sense of smell or taste are other relevant symptoms. If you think you may have symptoms of coronavirus you should use the NHS 111 online service for information, or NHS 24 if in Scotland.

The first report from this study included information about the outcomes of 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with coronavirus and their babies during the pandemic, and was published on 11 May. While most women in the study required only ward treatment and were discharged home well, around one in ten women required intensive care, and sadly five women with coronavirus died, although it is currently unclear if coronavirus was the cause of their death. The study found that the majority of women who did become severely ill were in their third trimester of pregnancy, emphasising the importance of social distancing from 28 weeks of pregnancy. The study also found that pregnant women from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds were more likely than other women to be admitted to hospital for coronavirus.

Where schools have live assignments with contingent workers, and where the school is the workers\u2019 employer, schools should continue to pay these workers from their existing school budgets and not furlough them. Where schools have terminated contracts with contingent workers due to coronavirus (COVID-19) earlier than the original terms set out, and where the school was the workers\u2019 employer under that contract, schools should reinstate these contracts on the terms previously agreed, as long as the contractor is not already accessing alternative support through another government support scheme.

Where schools have agency workers on live assignments who can continue to work, they may continue to make previously agreed payments for the supply of workers in line with the approach set out in PPN 02/20. Agencies who receive money for workers in line with this guidance should not furlough these workers, and should follow the open book accounting rules set out in PPN 02/20 to provide schools with proof that workers are continuing to be paid as normal. Where schools have agency workers on live assignments who cannot continue to work due to coronavirus (COVID-19), schools and agencies should refer to the guidance set out in Procurement Policy Note 02/20: Contingent Workers Impacted by COVID-19. The supplier relief guidance covers the length of existing live assignments up to the end date that had been previously agreed. It does not require these assignments to be extended further if the resource will not be required. Where agency workers are not on live assignments with schools, or where a previously agreed assignment is due to end, schools and agencies should discuss any further demand for the worker. If there is no further demand, the employer can apply to furlough the worker via the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Once a worker has been furloughed, they become unavailable to work and cannot provide services for their employer for a minimum of 3 weeks. Schools and agencies should bear this in mind when discussing ongoing resource requirements and agencies should keep this under regular review.

Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current scenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to different decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years. When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to which resources are overwhelmed in the current context. It would be inappropriate, for instance, to exclude population groups from being allocated a resource (for example, ventilators) at the outset of a pandemic when capacity remains. When resources are scarce, though \u2013 when there is an insufficient supply to meet everyone\u2019s needs \u2013 resource allocation should be guided by well established, broadly applicable ethical principles, unless there are characteristics of the outbreak that justify different courses of action.

Participants of research aimed at developing vaccines, therapies or other critical resources should receive some priority in receiving those resources because they have also helped save others by their participation. This is not an absolute priority \u2013 for example, it should not take precedence over giving priority to those most at risk in the case of resources such as vaccines. While the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocating resources in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice, it is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution centre, those with access to better information, or those who are most well-off. Younger populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context. Consequently, the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccine, but perhaps may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical care resources. The allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in different principles or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective, a lottery-based allocation may be justified among those as highest risk, the old and those with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines. Maximizing utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off: centralizing the availability of resources in larger centres may extend their benefits to more people, but may exclude isolated populations and challenge our concern for those at highest risk.

Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.  Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.  If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

WHO recommends the use of medical masks for the following individuals: Healthcare workers Why? Medical masks and respirators such as N95, FFP2 or equivalent are recommended for and should be reserved for, healthcare workers while giving care to patients. Healthcare workers are the most exposed because they are in close contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding environment, which are the main routes of transmission. People who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 Why? Anyone who is sick, even with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask as much as possible according to WHO\u2019s recommendation on home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing, sneezing or talking can generate droplets that can spread the infection. These droplets can reach the face of others nearby or land on the surrounding environment. If an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks wearing a medical mask, this helps to protect those nearby from infection. Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19 Why? Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection. Close and frequent contact with someone with COVID-19 can put those caring for them at high risk.

Gloves must be changed after carrying out non-food related activities such as opening/closing doors by hand, and emptying bins. Food workers should be aware that wearing gloves can allow bacteria to build up on the surface of the hands, so hand washing is extremely important when gloves are removed to avoid subsequent contamination of food. Food workers should not touch their mouth, nose and eyes when wearing gloves. Disposable gloves can give a false sense of safety and should not be used in the food work environment as a substitute for hand washing. The COVID-19 virus can contaminate disposable gloves in the same way it can get onto workers hands and contact surfaces. Removal of disposable gloves can lead to contamination of hands. Wearing disposable gloves can give you a false sense of security and may result in staff not washing hands as frequently as required. Handwashing is a greater protective barrier to infection than wearing of disposable gloves. Food businesses need to ensure adequate sanitary facilities are provided and ensure food workers thoroughly and frequently wash their hands. Soap and water is adequate for hand washing.

If an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is not available, then using chlorinated water (0.05%) for handwashing is an option, but it is not ideal because frequent use may irritate your skin. 2. **Cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when coughing and sneezing**. And remember to throw away the used tissue immediately in a bin with a lid and to wash your hands. This way you protect others from any virus released through coughs and sneezes. 3. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. ****Hands touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus. If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself. 4. Keep physical distance from others. If your national or local authorities have put in place confinement measures, it is important to respect them. Taking exercise outside is good for your physical and mental health, but should only be undertaken if regulations for your area allow it. When you do go out, avoid crowded spaces and maintain at least 1 metre distance (3 feet or arms-length) from others. Avoid unnecessary visits to your house. If visits are necessary (e.g. caregiver to support with activities of daily living), ask your visitor to regularly check for symptoms to ensure that they are symptom free when visiting you. Ask them to also follow these five key actions, including washing their hands when they first enter your home. 5. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces every day.

Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.   Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre- symptomatic transmission \u2013transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms \u2013 is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.   The reproductive number \u2013 the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual \u2013 is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.   Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.   While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.   Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.   Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower.
