This may be a refund or credit note or voucher, depending on your circumstances. If you receive a credit note or voucher, it should have an expiration date which is long enough to allow you to use the credit note or voucher. State and territory consumer protection agencies may be able to assist with guidance or conciliation involving relevant state legislation. Consumers may also wish to seek independent legal advice about whether they may have a remedy under common law, contract or state legislation.

The Government will provide eligible lenders with a guarantee for loans with the following terms:  SMEs, including sole traders, with a turnover of up to $50 million. Maximum total size of loans of $250,000 per borrower. Loans will be up to three years, with an initial six month repayment holiday. Unsecured finance, meaning that borrowers will not have to provide an asset as security for the loan.  The decision on whether to extend credit, and management of the loan, will remain with the lender. However, the Government expects that lenders will look through the cycle to sensibly take into account the uncertainty of the current economic conditions when determining whether credit should be extended. As part of the loan products available, the Government will encourage lenders to provide facilities to SMEs that only have to be drawn if needed by the SME. This will mean that the SME would only incur interest on the amount they draw down. If they do not draw down any funds from the facility, no interest will be charged, but they will retain the flexibility to draw down funds should the need arise. SMEs interested in the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme should approach their financial institution for more information. The Government is working with banks and other eligible lenders to ensure loans are available as soon as possible. While the scheme officially commences from April 2020, your bank or other lenders may be able to provide credit sooner, and still benefit from the guarantee. The Treasurer has varied the authorisation conditions for the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) scheme to limit the matters that AFCA can consider in relation to certain decisions made by lenders under the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme. Under the AFCA Scheme Authorisation (Additional Condition) Amendment 2020, the AFCA Scheme Rules will be amended to limit AFCA\u2019s ability to consider decisions made by the lender about whether to provide a loan (and the amount of the loan) under the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme and ensure that when making assessments or determinations about a complaint, AFCA gives consideration to the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and the intent and requirements of the Scheme. The amendments to AFCA\u2019s authorisation conditions also apply to decisions made by lenders (all lenders and not only those lenders that are participating lenders under the Scheme) to approve repayment deferrals for businesses in response to the coronavirus crisis. The amendments exclude from AFCA\u2019s remit complaints in relation to decisions by lenders to offer repayment deferrals to businesses impacted by the coronavirus, and any consequential change to the amounts payable under the loan or the duration of the loan.

For all other services, it is\u00ad the fortnight starting 17 February 2020. Where a service charged fees for only one week of care during the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, or in the school holidays between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019, the amount will be calculated on the week in which care occurred and the amount doubled.  Example A Centre Based Day Care (CBDC) service charges $100 for a 10 hour session of care. Therefore, their hourly fee is $10 per hour ($100 \u00f7 10 = $10). As $10 is less than the CBDC hourly rate cap of $11.98, $10 is the amount used. On the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, the CBDC service had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care for the fortnight (or five per week) and were charged $100 for a ten hour session (meaning the hourly fee was $10). For that fortnight, the service\u2019s total fees charged were $20,000 (or $10,000 per week). The payment this service will receive is worked out below:  the hourly payment is $5 ($10 x 50% = $5) $5 hourly payment x 10 hour session = $50 payment per session $50 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,000 paid per week.

For all other services\u2013the fortnight starting 17 February 2020. Note: where a service charged fees for only part of the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, or in the school holidays between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019, an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment will be made in accordance with these rules.  For example  An OSHC service that operates in New South Wales provides only vacation care. Therefore, their reference period is 30 September 2019 to 13 October 2019.  For example  An OSHC service provides both vacation care and before and after school care. Their reference period is from 17 February 2020 to 1 March 2020.  For example  An OSHC service operating in New South Wales providing only vacation care, charged fees for one week in the school holiday period between Terms 3 and 4 in 2019. However, the reference fortnight for the service does not change, meaning that the base weekly amount for the provider of the service that is calculated under the Rules, would be effectively half of the amount it would be if the service had operated for the full reference fortnight, instead of only one week. However, the provider of the service will receive an Exceptional Circumstance Supplementary Payment to adjust for the week.  The payment amount will be determined based on the total fees charged by the service during a reference fortnight and the reference hourly fee (up to hourly rate cap) for a session of care. For example On the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a Centre Based Day Care service (CBDC) had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care for the fortnight (or five per week) and were charged $100 for a 10 hour session (meaning the hourly fee was $10). This example assumes that all of the children were charged the same amount for the same session lengths. For that fortnight, the service\u2019s total fees charged were $20,000 (or $10,000 per week). The payment this service will receive is worked out below:  the service\u2019s hourly reference fee is $10 (because it is lower than the CBDC hourly rate cap) $10 hourly fee x 50 per cent = $5 paid per hour $5 x 10 hour session = $50 paid per session $50 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,000 paid per week.  For example: On the fortnight starting 17 February 2020, a CBDC service had 20 children attending the service. Each child attended 10 sessions of care per fortnight (or five per week) and was charged $130 for a 10 hour session (meaning the hourly fee was $13). This example assumes that all of the children were charged the same amount for the same session lengths. For that fortnight, the service\u2019s total fees charged were $26,000 (or $13,000 per week). The payment is worked out below:  the service\u2019s hourly reference fee is $11.98 (because their hourly fee is above the CBDC hourly rate cap at $13) $11.98 x 50 per cent = $5.99 paid in business continuity per hour $5.99 x 10 hour session = $59.90 paid in business continuity per session $59.90 x 20 children x 5 sessions per week = $5,990 paid to the service per week.

Therefore, their hourly fee is $10 per hour ($100 \u00f7 10 = $10) The CBDC hourly rate cap is $11.98 The reference hourly fee is the hourly fee ($10) because it is lower 50 per cent of the hourly session fee is $5 ($10 x 50 per cent = $5).

Gloves should be worn when touching potentially contaminated items or applying disinfectants and it is important to perform hand hygiene upon removing gloves or other PPE. Law enforcement personnel who have an exposure should be evaluated by their occupational health program and may be able to finish their work shift before starting home isolation. If personnel and resources are available, it is most protective for law enforcement personnel to stay at home until 14 days after exposure to an individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 if the exposure was prolonged (10 minutes or more) or if the exposure was of concern (e.g., the individual coughed into the face of the law enforcement officer). This would best protect the health of the exposed worker, their co-workers, and the general public. However, if personnel and resources are not available, law enforcement personnel (considered critical infrastructure workers) may be permitted to work after exposure to ensure continuity of operations. To continue working, the exposed worker should remain symptom-free, and the employer should put into place the following prevention strategies for the exposed worker:  Screen the worker for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) before each work shift Regularly monitor the worker for symptoms, under the supervision of an occupational health program Ensure the worker practices social distancing (remaining at least 6 feet away from others) Ensure the worker wears a facemask (or cloth face covering if facemasks are unavailable) to protect others  If an exposed worker develops symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) and is still working, the employer should:  Send the worker home immediately and encourage them to follow CDC guidance for What to Do If You Are Sick.

Law enforcement personnel should limit the number of personnel needed to enter the building, if feasible. If the building has not been cleared, law enforcement personnel should wear the following PPE:  A single pair of disposable examination gloves Disposable isolation gown or single use coveralls Fit-tested NIOSH approved N95 respirator or higher level of protection (or a facemask if respirators are unavailable) Eye protection (goggles or a disposable face shield).  Further, law enforcement personnel should try to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet distance) with others at all times, especially while in the structure. If the building has been cleared, then it may not be necessary to wear respiratory and eye protection, unless there are other hazards present that dictate their use according to an onsite hazard/risk assessment.

However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. People who have serious chronic medical conditions are believed to be at higher risk.

N95 respirators are tight-fitting respirators that filter out at least 95% of particles in the air, including large and small particles. Not everyone is able to wear a respirator due to medical conditions that may be made worse when breathing through a respirator. Before using a respirator or getting fit-tested, workers must have a medical evaluation to make sure that they are able to wear a respirator safely. Achieving an adequate seal to the face is essential. United States regulations require that workers undergo an annual fit test and conduct a user seal check each time the respirator is used. Workers must pass a fit test to confirm a proper seal before using a respirator in the workplace. When properly fitted and worn, minimal leakage occurs around edges of the respirator when the user inhales. This means almost all of the air is directed through the filter media. Unlike NIOSH-approved N95s, facemasks are loose-fitting and provide only barrier protection against droplets, including large respiratory particles. No fit testing or seal check is necessary with facemasks. Most facemasks do not effectively filter small particles from the air and do not prevent leakage around the edge of the mask when the user inhales. The role of facemasks is for patient source control, to prevent contamination of the surrounding area when a person coughs or sneezes. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask until they are isolated in a hospital or at home. The patient does not need to wear a facemask while isolated.

To keep patients and healthcare personnel (HCP) healthy and safe, CDC\u2019s infection prevention and control guidance applies to all settings where healthcare is delivered. However, as with any guidance, facilities can tailor certain recommendations to their setting. For example, inpatient psychiatric care includes communal experiences and group activities that may need to continue. If so, these activities might need to be adapted to align with social distancing recommendations. Other recommended infection control measures (for example, ensuring access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, cohorting patients with COVID-19 and assigning dedicated staff, or implementing universal source control measures) might not be safe or appropriate to implement in all locations or for all patients due to security and behavioral concerns. Challenges and potential solutions specific to behavioral health settings might include:  Cohorting  Challenge: To prevent transmission, it is generally recommended that patients with COVID-19 be transferred to a separate area of the facility where they can be cared for by dedicated HCP. Because of security concerns or specialized care needs, it might not be possible to cohort certain patients together or change HCP assigned to their care. Potential Solutions: When cohorting is not possible, implement measures to maintain social distancing (at least 6 feet) between patients with COVID-19 and others on the unit. Ideally, this would include a separate bathroom for COVID-19 patients. Ensure HCP wear all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.   Group Therapy Sessions  Challenge : Group counseling, therapy, and discussion sessions are a critical component of psychiatric treatment and care plans, but the traditional set-up for these activities is not compatible with social distancing recommendations. Potential Solutions : When possible, use virtual methods, or decrease group size so social distancing can be maintained. In the event that COVID-19 is transmitted in the facility, sessions should stop or move to a video discussion forum until additional infection prevention measures are in place to stop the spread.   Cloth Face Coverings  Challenge: For some patients, the use of cloth face coverings or facemasks might pose an additional danger or may cause distress. Some patients may be unable or unwilling to use them as intended. Elastic and cloth straps can be used for strangling oneself or others, and metal nasal bridges can be used for self-harm or as a weapon. Potential Solutions: Consider allowing patients at low risk for misuse to wear cloth face coverings or facemasks, with a preference for those with short ear-loops rather than longer ties. Consider use of cloth face coverings or facemasks during supervised group activities. Ensure that HCP interacting with patients who cannot wear a cloth face covering or facemask are wearing eye protection and a facemask (or a respirator if the patient is suspected to have COVID-19 and respirators are available).   Alcohol-based Hand Sanitizer  Challenge : While alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) containing 60-95% alcohol is an important tool to increase adherence to hand hygiene recommendations, ABHS must be used carefully in psychiatric facilities to ensure it is not ingested by patients. Potential Solutions : Consider not placing ABHS in patients\u2019 rooms in psychiatric facilities, nor in locations where the patients have unsupervised access. Encourage frequent hand washing with soap and water for patients and HCP. Consider providing personal, pocket-sized ABHS dispensers for HCP.   Dining  Challenge : As part of social distancing, communal dining is generally not recommended. However, eating needs to remain supervised due to the potential for self-harm with eating utensils and because commonly used psychiatric medications may cause side effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, dysphagia, hypo- and hypersalivation) that increase choking risk for patients. Potential Solutions : One option is to position staff in patients\u2019 rooms to monitor their dining. Another option is to allow communal dining in shifts so that staff can monitor patients while ensuring they remain at least 6 feet apart. A third option is to have patients sit in appropriately spaced chairs in the hallway outside their rooms so they can be monitored while they eat.   Smoking  Challenge: A higher proportion of psychiatric patients smoke cigarettes compared to the general population. Patients might congregate in outdoor smoking spaces without practicing appropriate social distancing. Potential Solutions: Limit the number of patients allowed to access smoking spacesat the same time, and position staff to observe and ensure patients are practicing appropriate physical distancing.

Current data suggest that close-range aerosol transmission by droplet and inhalation, and contact followed by self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth are likely routes of transmission. Long-range aerosol transmission, such as is seen with measles, has not been a feature of SARS-CoV-2. Potential routes of close-range transmission include splashes and sprays of infectious material onto mucous membranes and inhalation of infectious virions exhaled by an infected person. The relative contribution of each of these is not known for SARS-Co-V-2. Facemasks commonly used during surgical procedures will provide barrier protection against droplet sprays contacting mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, but they are not designed to protect wearers from inhaling small particles. N95 and higher level respirators, such as other disposable filtering facepiece respirators, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and elastomeric respirators, provide both barrier and respiratory protection because of their tight fit and filtration characteristics. Respirators should be used as part of a respiratory protection program that provides staff with medical evaluations, training, and fit testing. Although facemasks are routinely used for the care of patients with common viral respiratory infections, N95 or higher level respirators are routinely recommended for emerging pathogens like SARS CoV-2, which have the potential for transmission via small particles, the ability to cause severe infections, and no specific treatments or vaccines. CDC recommendations acknowledge the current challenges with limited supplies of N95s and other respirators. Facilities that do not have sufficient supplies of N95s and other respirators for all patient care should prioritize their use for activities and procedures that pose high risks of generating infectious aerosols and use facemasks for care that does not involve those activities or procedures.

If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask or cloth face covering to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet. If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear all recommended PPE (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask\u2014if a respirator is not available\u2014and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene. If the patient is wearing a facemask or cloth face covering, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient\u2019s room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask). After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear all recommended PPE. If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States.

To protect patients and co-workers, HCP should wear a facemask at all times while they are in a healthcare facility (i.e., practice source control). Use of a facemask, instead of a cloth face covering, is recommended for HCP, because a facemask offers both source control and protection from exposure to splashes and sprays of infectious material from others.  HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should continue to wear gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), and eye protection (i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face).  HCP working in facilities located in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission are more likely to encounter asymptomatic patients with COVID-19.

All firefighters and support personnel should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is thought to spread, what the symptoms of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. During the fire season, it will be important that members of each fire crew or module make an effort to operate and isolate as a unit. Management will need to develop and implement procedures and protocols to prevent possible exposures to the virus. When possible, crews should not interchange personnel or equipment between units and should limit the number of personnel who must interact with people in the community (e.g. fueling vehicles, picking up supplies, etc.). This will require planning and using technology to safely accomplish tasks while maintaining social distancing as much as possible. This may include implementing procedures that allow fire crews or incident management personnel to stay remote, isolate from other units, or complete tasks or missions virtually. If close contact with others in the community is necessary, it is advised that all personnel wear facemasks or cloth face coverings for source control.

This plan should be shared with you and your coworkers. Employers should: Reduce transmission among employees  Take steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if an employee is sick.  Actively encourage sick employees to stay home. Sick employees diagnosed with COVID-19 shouldn\u2019t return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments. Provide employees with accurate information about COVID-19, how it spreads, and risk of exposure. Be aware that some employees may be at higher risk for serious illness, such as older adults and those with chronic medical conditions. Implement specific policies to minimize face-to-face contact between these employees or assign work tasks that allow them to maintain a distance of six feet from other workers, customers and visitors, or to telework if possible. Provide training to employees on proper hand washing practices and other routine preventative measures. This will help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.   Provide employees with access to soap, clean running water, and materials for drying their hands, and provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol at stations around the establishment for use by both workers and customers.  Maintain a healthy work environment  Institute measures to physically separate and increase distance between employees, other coworkers, and customers, such as:  Configure partitions with a pass-through opening at the bottom of the barrier in checkout lanes, customer service desks, and pharmacy and liquor store counters as a barrier shield, if possible. Use every other check-out lane to aid in distancing. Move the electronic payment terminal/credit card reader farther away from the cashier in order to increase the distance between the customer and the cashier, if possible. Use verbal announcements on the loudspeaker and place signage throughout the establishment, at entrances, in restrooms, and in breakrooms to remind employees and customers to maintain distances of 6 feet from others. Place visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, or signs to indicate to customers where they should stand during check out. Shift primary stocking activities to off-peak or after hours when possible to reduce contact with customers. Remove or rearrange chairs and tables or add visual cue marks in employee break rooms to support social distancing practices between employees. Identify alternative areas such as closed customer seating spaces to accommodate overflow volume.   Provide remote shopping alternatives for customers, including click-and-collect, delivery, pick-up, and shop-by-phone to limit customers in the establishment. Set up designated pick-up areas. Control the flow of traffic into the establishment by ensuring that maximum capacity plans are adjusted and managed at the front door. Place posters that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, and good hand hygiene at the entrance to the workplace and in other workplace areas where they are likely to be seen. Provide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for use by employees. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces within the establishments. If the surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them prior to disinfecting. To disinfect, use products that meet EPA\u2019s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s label for disinfection, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and are appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer\u2019s directions for use.  Clean frequently touched shelving, displays, and reach-in refrigerator units nightly when closed to the public. Conduct frequent cleaning of employee break rooms, rest areas, and other common areas. Clean grocery carts and baskets. Require employees to clean out lockers nightly to facilitate overnight deep cleaning processes.   Provide disposable disinfectant wipes, cleaner, or spray so employees can wipe down frequently touched surfaces such as workstations, cash registers, credit card touch pad, door handles, conveyer belts, tables, cart handles, and countertops. Follow all applicable local, state, and federal regulations and public health agency guidelines.  Maintain healthy business operations  Designate a person who is responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. Employees should know who this person is and how to contact them. Consider using a hotline for employees to voice concerns anonymously. Implement flexible worksites (telework) for office staff to the extent feasible. Limit travel for multi-store personnel to only what is required for critical facility functions. Whenever possible, conduct conversations through phone calls. Leverage closed-circuit television (camera systems) to remotely view facilities as opposed to physically visiting the location. Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. Consider drafting non-punitive emergency sick leave policies if sick leave is not offered to some or all employees. Employers should not require a positive COVID-19 test result or a healthcare provider\u2019s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work. Provide information on who to contact if employees become sick. If an employee is confirmed to have COVID-19 infection, employers should inform fellow employees of their possible exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace but maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Implement a system in which relief workers rotate into the cashier station to allow cashiers to leave the station to wash their hands regularly.

Viral (nucleic acid and antigen) tests are used to diagnose the presence of SARS- CoV-2 infections. In contrast, antibody tests can detect IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies from an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Whenever possible, laboratories should rely on viral tests to diagnose the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a negative result from viral testing does not rule out COVID-19. Most of the PCR-based tests that use two or more targets are likely to have high specificity (few false positives). However, there is some variation in the stated sensitivity of the different assays, and sensitivity is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. For this reason, negative results should always be interpreted in the context of the exposure history and symptoms of the patient. Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude SARS- CoV-2 infections or to inform infection status. Negative results from antibody testing do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly for those individuals who have been exposed to the virus and are still within the estimated incubation period. Until the performance characteristics of antibody tests have been evaluated, it is possible that positive results from such testing may be due to past or present infections with a coronavirus other than SARS-CoV-2. If a laboratory initially uses antibody testing for diagnostic purposes, follow-up testing using a viral test should be performed.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, those expectations may need to be relaxed to protect the safety of those who would have participated. People continue to get exposed to COVID-19 at funeral services ; the people giving it to others were not feeling sick at the time and did not know they were carrying or spreading COVID-19. Consider the following modifications to funeral services and visitations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These modifications are recommended for events held in any setting, including funeral homes, cemetery facilities, places of worship, private homes, and other venues. Limit the attendees to a small number of immediate family and close friends  Follow the guidelines from state and local officials and state and local health departments. Those who are sick, have a household member or other close contact who is sick, or are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should not attend in person. Consider limiting the number of people from different areas of the country or any areas with significant spread of COVID-19. Consider offering other ways for family and friends to participate, such as by phone or online (live or recorded).  Practice social distancing and everyday preventive actions  Consider holding services and gatherings in a large, well-ventilated area or outdoors, as circumstances and traditions allow. Space out seating for attendees who do not live in the same household to at least six feet apart. Attendees who do not live in the same household should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart and wear a cloth face covering when interacting with people who do not live in their household. People who have been living in the same household can comfort each other in typical ways such as hugging, holding hands, and sitting next to each other. Attendees should nod, bow, or wave instead of holding or shaking hands, hugging, or kissing anyone who does not live in their household. All attendees should follow everyday preventive actions to protect themselves and others from COVID-19, such as washing your hands often and covering coughs and sneezes.  Consider changing traditional rituals or practices Discuss with the funeral home director, clergy or officiant, and your family any potential changes that might be necessary to protect all of the participants and attendees. Consider options for modified or new practices that would be acceptable to you and your family and friends, such as:  Holding a graveside-only service. Changing or removing funeral practices that involve close contact or sharing things among members of different households, such as:  Sharing a car or limousine ride between the church and cemetery. Providing food and beverages for attendees after the service.   Changing religious rituals in consultation with clergy and other religious leaders.  If some traditions, such as certain religious rituals, sharing rides to the gravesite, or having food and beverages, are considered essential to you and your family and friends, consider modifying them.  Limit sharing of items, such as worship aids, prayer books, and other items shared or passed by clergy and attendees during religious rituals. Group household members together inside the vehicle. Avoid having non-household members sharing vehicles to travel between locations during the services; if necessary, increase ventilation by opening windows or using the air conditioner on non-recirculating mode. Have pre-packaged meal boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal.  In some cultures, bringing food or gifts to grieving family members is an important way to express care and concern. During the COVID-19 pandemic, consider expressing care in ways that do not involve personal interactions. Consider delivering food or gifts to grieving family members in ways that keep people at least 6 feet apart, mailing care packages, or giving families gift cards for food delivery services. Avoid touching the deceased person\u2019s body before preparation There are many different cultural traditions involved in the bereavement process, including some that involve touching the deceased person\u2019s body before preparation. Though we are still learning more about how COVID-19 spreads, it may be possible that you could get COVID-19 by touching the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 prior to the body being prepared for viewing. After the body has been prepared for viewing, there may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging. Take steps to protect yourself, such as:  Avoid touching, hugging, or kissing the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 before and during body preparation, especially if you or a member of your household are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after any contact with the body. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.  Take precautions with rituals that involve touching the deceased person\u2019s body If the deceased person had confirmed or suspected COVID-19, avoid kissing, washing, or shrouding the body before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. Take precautions if participating in these activities is part of important religious or cultural practices.  Work with your cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff to identify how to reduce exposure as much as possible. People at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and members of their household should not be involved in these activities. People conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves (nitrile, latex, or rubber). Additional protective equipment may also be required, such as disposable and waterproof isolation gowns, face shields or goggles, and facemasks (e.g., if splashing of fluids is expected). Following preparation of the body, safely remove gloves (and other protective equipment, if used) and throw them away. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Shower as soon as possible. If you did not wear an isolation gown while preparing the body, wash your clothes in the warmest setting possible and dry them completely.  If removing personal possessions (such as wedding rings) from the body or casket, clean and disinfect the items and wash hands right away.

The most protective methods incorporate social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others), or physical barriers to eliminate or minimize the screener\u2019s exposures due to close contact with a person who has symptoms during screening. Examples to consider that incorporate these types of controls for temperature screening include:  Reliance on Social Distancing : Ask employees to take their own temperature either before coming to the workplace or upon arrival at the workplace. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the employee and:  Ask the employee to confirm that their temperature is less than 100.4o F (38.0o C), and confirm that they are not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath. Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue. Screening staff do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if they can maintain a distance of 6 feet.   Reliance on Barrier/Partition Controls : During screening, the screener stands behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition, that can protect the screener\u2019s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced when the employee sneezes, coughs, or talks. Upon arrival, the screener should wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or, if soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Then:  Make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks or fatigue. Conduct temperature and symptom screening using this protocol:  Put on disposable gloves. Check the employee\u2019s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window. Make sure the screener\u2019s face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening. If performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, make sure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each employee and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check. If disposable or non-contact thermometers are used and you did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness.

High touch surfaces include: Tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.    Disinfect   Recommend use of EPA-registered household disinfectant . Follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many products recommend:  Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see product label). Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.    Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used if appropriate for the surface.   Check the label to see if your bleach is intended for disinfection, and ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Leave solution on the surface for at least 1 minute.  To make a bleach solution , mix:      5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water OR   4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water     Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.  Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.

Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. Remove gloves, and wash hands right away.  Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas  Outdoor areas, like playgrounds in schools and parks generally require normal routine cleaning , but do not require disinfection. Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds- it is not an efficient use of supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID-19 to the public. High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended.   Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected. Spread of COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective.    When cleaning  Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces.  Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals.   Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash.  Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area.   Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.  Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person who is sick. Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used.

Provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus. Develop policies for worker protection and provide training to all cleaning staff on site prior to providing cleaning tasks.  Training should include when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of PPE.   Ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA\u2019s Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200).

COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person, so steps should be taken to reduce the risks for people visiting your facility.  Encourage employees and other visitors, including boarders, owners, farriers, veterinarians, and those taking lessons, not to enter the facility if they are sick. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, after talking with their doctor. Implement sick leave policies that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection. Consider conducting daily health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees and others visiting the facility before they enter the premises. People with a fever of 100.40(38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the premises. If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully. See General Business FAQs for more information.  Employees or visitors who appear to have symptoms upon arrival or who become sick during their visit should immediately be separated from other employees and visitors and sent home.   Limit the number of people entering the facility. Consider staggering lesson and visiting times to limit the number of people in the facility and potential for person-to-person contact. If possible, you can also take steps to decrease high-traffic areas by limiting areas open to visitors/owners or staggering use of common areas like grooming or wash stalls and tack rooms. Increase distance and limit duration of contact between employees and visitors in the facility. Whenever possible, people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance between each other at the facility, including instructors teaching lessons. Allow for social distancing and avoid large numbers of people within the facility, including in employee-only areas. Visitors and employees should wear cloth face coverings to protect others especially where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Wearing a cloth face covering does NOT replace the need to practice social distancing.

Call before you take your pet to the veterinary clinic. Be sure to alert your veterinarian if your pet has trouble breathing, or if you think it is an emergency. While most pets appear to show only mild symptoms or no symptoms, we are still learning about how they are affected by the virus. Even if your pet appears to be feeling better, avoid the following activities until your veterinarian determines that it is safe for your pet to do so or your pet has met the guidance to end their isolation:  Visits to veterinary hospitals, without calling the veterinarian first Visits to human healthcare facilities or schools Visits to parks (including dog parks), markets, or other gatherings such as festivals Visits to the groomer, including mobile grooming salons Visits to pet daycares or boarding facilities Other outings such as playdates, hikes, or visiting other homes, with or without pets Using dog walkers or pet-sitters that live outside your home    Separate your pet from other people and pets in your home   Have the pet stay in a designated \u201csick room\u201d (such as a laundry room or extra bathroom) if possible, or otherwise be separated from people and other animals. This is the same way a person with COVID-19 would separate from others in their household.   Avoid contact with the pet as much as possible, including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.  If possible, provide a separate litterbox or bathroom area from other pets.  DOGS: If you have a private backyard where your dog can go to the bathroom, do not take them for walks. If you must walk your dog, limit it to bathroom breaks only, stay close to your home, and keep your pet at least 6 feet away from other pets and people. Do not let other people touch or interact with your dog. CATS: Cats should be kept inside. Do not allow cats that have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 to roam outside. CLEANING UP: There is no evidence to suggest that waste from infected pets needs any additional disinfection. Wear gloves when cleaning up after your pet, and place fecal material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before disposing. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet.   Provide bedding, bowls or containers, treats, and toys that are separate from those used by other people or animals in the household.    Disinfect bowls, toys, and other animal care items with an EPA-registered disinfectant and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Soft items like towels, blankets, and other bedding, can be safely laundered and reused. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill animal can be washed with other items.    Monitor your pet\u2019s symptoms It is important to keep track of your pet\u2019s symptoms during home isolation. If you think your pet has new symptoms or is getting worse, call your veterinarian. Pets sick with COVID-19 may have:  Fever Coughing Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Lethargy (unusual laziness or sluggish) Sneezing Runny nose Eye discharge Vomiting Diarrhea  Follow all care instructions from your veterinarian. Your veterinarian may have you keep a written log of your pet\u2019s symptoms. If your pet develops new symptoms or seems to be getting worse, including trouble breathing, you should call your veterinarian right away. Your veterinarian may be able to advise you over the phone or may tell you to bring your pet to their clinic or go to another clinic that can better care for your pet. Protect yourself when caring for a sick pet  Follow similar recommended precautions as for people caring for an infected person at home. If you are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, another household member should care for the pet, if possible. People should wear a cloth face covering and gloves in the same room or area as the sick pet.  Animals should not wear a cloth face covering or mask. Do not try to put a cloth face covering on your pet.   Use gloves when handling the pet\u2019s dishes, toys, or bedding and when picking up feces (poop). Throw out gloves and place waste material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before throwing away in a trashcan lined with a trash bag. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet. Clean your hands regularly throughout the day.  Wash hands: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each Make sure everyone in the home does the same, especially after touching the sick pet or handling their dishes, toys, or bedding. Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Do not touch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.   Clean and then disinfect:  Follow cleaning and disinfecting recommendations found on CDC\u2019s Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products not intended or approved for use on animals. There is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people or other animals from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, \u201cstay at home orders,\u201d and limits to gatherings have affected the ability of friends and family to come together in person and grieve in typical ways. This is true regardless of whether the person\u2019s death was due to COVID-19 or some other cause. Fortunately, most people understand that hosting gatherings now could be dangerous to those who would want to participate. Family and friends are finding alternate ways to connect, support each other, and grieve after their loss. They understand the need to possibly plan for additional memorial services when COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted. Take actions to help you cope with the loss of a loved one Grief is a universal emotion, but no two people experience grief in exactly the same way. Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of grief while practicing social distancing and honoring your loved one include:  Invite people to call you, or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected. Ask family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via phone, video chat, email, text message, photo sharing apps, social media, or mailed letters. Create a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories. Coordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer from within their own households. Some cultures practice a prolonged mourning period with multiple observances, so hosting virtual events now and in-person events later may be in keeping with these practices. Seek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. People who are not part of a faith tradition or religious community can seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends. Use grief counseling services, support groups, or hotlines, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider. Read books about grief and loss. If you have children, read age-appropriate books with them and talk with them about how they are feeling. Take part in an activity that has significance to you and the loved one you have lost, such as planting flowers or a tree or preparing a favorite meal, in memory of your loved one. Review additional information from CDC on loss and grief, and ways to cope with stress and anxiety.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who died of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as people avoiding them or rejecting them. Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger toward other people. Some people may avoid contact with you, your family members, and friends when they would normally reach out to you. You can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with extended family, friends, and others in your community. Practice social distancing while making funeral arrangements  Consider having virtual or phone meetings instead of in-person meetings with funeral home staff, cemetery staff, clergy or officiants, and others to plan funeral arrangements. If you need to meet in person, follow everyday preventive actions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19, such as wearing a cloth face covering, social distancing, washing your hands often, and covering coughs and sneezes. Do not attend in-person meetings if you are sick, might have been exposed to COVID-19, or have higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.  Discuss options for making changes to traditional funeral plans  Discuss your cultural or religious traditions and the funeral wishes of the deceased, if applicable, with family members and the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiants).  Identify any potential concerns and determine options to make changes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preserve traditional practices when it is possible to safely do so, and identify whether modified or new practices could satisfy the needs and values of you and your loved one.   Consider whether it would be acceptable to hold modified funeral arrangements by limiting attendance to a small number of immediate family members and friends shortly after the time of death. Consider holding additional memorial services in the future when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive.  When you are making decisions about who should attend, consider how emotionally difficult social distancing practices might be for attendees (such as keeping at least 6 feet apart and not hugging other attendees who do not live in their household).   Ask the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiant) about resources they may be able to provide, such as:  Virtual funeral services, visitations, and memorial tributes by online video streaming or recorded video.

HCP should always deliberately assess potential risks of exposure to infectious material before engaging in activities and procedures in healthcare delivery. Based on their risk assessment, safe work practices, including engineering controls that reduce the release of infectious material, administrative controls, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) should be implemented at the point of care according to CDC guidelines and standards of practice for the activity performed. To reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC recommends that facilities:  consider nonoperative approaches when feasible; minimize the use of procedures or techniques that might produce infectious aerosols when feasible; minimize the number of people in the operating or procedure room to reduce exposures; use the extent of community transmission and an assessment of the likelihood for patient harm if care is delayed to make decisions about cancelling or postponing elective surgeries and procedures; and implement universal source control measures, which includes having patients wear a cloth face covering (as tolerated) and having HCP wear a facemask at all times while they are in the healthcare facility.  If surgery or procedures cannot be postponed, HCP caring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should adhere to all recommended infection prevention and control practices for COVID-19. This includes:  Using all recommended PPE: an N95 or higher-level respirator (or facemask if respirators are not available), eye protection, gloves, and a gown.  Respirators with exhalation valves should not be used during surgical procedures as unfiltered exhaled breath would compromise the sterile field. If shortages exist, N95 or higher-level respirators should be prioritized for procedures involving higher risk techniques (e.g., that generate potentially infectious aerosols) or that involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (e.g., nose and throat, oropharynx, respiratory tract).   As part of routine practice, HCP should also be using additional engineering controls for source control, when applicable (e.g., smoke evacuation devices).  Because COVID-19 can be transmitted asymptomatically, some infected individuals will not be identified based on clinical signs and symptoms. HCP providing surgical or procedural care to patients not suspected of having COVID-19 should use a tiered approach based on the level of community transmission to inform the need for universal eye protection and respirator use (see FAQ addressing recommended PPE when caring for asymptomatic patients who are not suspected to have COVID-19).

Your local health authorities may give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information.  Call ahead before visiting your doctor  Call ahead. Many medical visits for routine care are being postponed or done by phone or telemedicine. If you have a medical appointment that cannot be postponed, call your doctor\u2019s office, and tell them you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the office protect themselves and other patients.  If you are sick wear a cloth covering over your nose and mouth   You should wear acloth face covering, over your nose and mouth if you must be around other people or animals, including pets (even at home)   You don\u2019t need to wear the cloth face covering if you are alone. If you can\u2019t put on a cloth face covering (because of trouble breathing, for example), cover your coughs and sneezes in some other way. Try to stay at least 6 feet away from other people. This will help protect the people around you.   Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2 years, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is not able to remove the covering without help.   Note: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical grade facemasks are reserved for healthcare workers and some first responders. You may need to make a cloth face covering using a scarf or bandana. Cover your coughs and sneezes  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away used tissues in a lined trash can.

Let someone else clean and disinfect surfaces in common areas, but you should clean your bedroom and bathroom, if possible.  If a caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect a sick person\u2019s bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis. The caregiver/other person should wear a mask and disposable gloves prior to cleaning. They should wait as long as possible after the person who is sick has used the bathroom before coming in to clean and use the bathroom.   Clean and disinfect areas that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.   Use household cleaners and disinfectants. Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty. Then, use a household disinfectant.    Be sure to follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many products recommend keeping the surface wet for several minutes to ensure germs are killed. Many also recommend precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. Most EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective.

People are thought to be most contagious when they are symptomatic (the sickest). That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others. More recently the virus has also been detected in asymptomatic persons. How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy (i.e. time since illness started and time since recovery) in consultation with state and local public health officials. The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.

In public health emergencies, these conditions can also isolate people from the resources they need to prepare for and respond to outbreaks.1,13, 14 Living conditions For many people in racial and ethnic minority groups, living conditions may contribute to underlying health conditions and make it difficult to follow steps to prevent getting sick with COVID-19 or to seek treatment if they do get sick.  Members of racial and ethnic minorities may be more likely to live in densely populated areas because of institutional racism in the form of residential housing segregation. People living in densely populated areas may find it more difficult to practice prevention measures such as social distancing. Research also suggests that racial residential segregation is a fundamental cause of health disparities. For example, racial residential segregation is linked with a variety of adverse health outcomes and underlying health conditions.2-5 These underlying conditions can also increase the likelihood of severe illness from COVID-19. Many members of racial and ethnic minorities live in neighborhoods that are further from grocery stores and medical facilities , making it more difficult to receive care if sick and stock up on supplies that would allow them to stay home. Multi-generational households , which may be more common among some racial and ethnic minority families6, may find it difficult to take precautions to protect older family members or isolate those who are sick, if space in the household is limited. Racial and ethnic minority groups are over-represented in jails, prisons, and detention centers , which have specific risks due to congregate living, shared food service, and more.  Work circumstances The types of work and policies in the work environments where people in some racial and ethnic groups are overrepresented can also contribute to their risk for getting sick with COVID-19. Examples include:  Critical workers: The risk of infection may be greater for workers in essential industries who continue to work outside the home despite outbreaks in their communities, including some people who may need to continue working in these jobs because of their economic circumstances.  Nearly a quarter of employed Hispanic and Black or African American workers are employed in service industry jobs compared to 16% of non-Hispanic whites. Hispanic workers account for 17% of total employment but constitute 53% of agricultural workers; Black or African Americans make up 12% of all employed workers, but account for 30% of licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses.7   A lack of paid sick leave: Workers without paid sick leave might be more likely to continue to work even when they are sick for any reason. This can increase workers exposure to other workers who may have COVID-19, or, in turn, expose others them if they themselves have COVID-19. Hispanic workers have lower rates of access to paid leave than white non-Hispanic workers.8  Underlying health conditions and lower access to care Existing health disparities, such as poorer underlying health and barriers to getting health care, might make members of many racial and ethnic minority groups especially vulnerable in public health emergencies like outbreaks of COVID-19.  Not having health insurance: Compared to whites, Hispanics are almost 3 times as likely to be uninsured, and African Americans are almost twice as likely to be uninsured.9 In all age groups, blacks were more likely than whites to report not being able to see a doctor in the past year because of cost.10 Inadequate access is also driven by a long-standing distrust of the health care system, language barriers, and financial implications associated with missing work to receive care. S erious underlying medical conditions : Compared to whites, black Americans experience higher death rates, and higher prevalence rates of chronic conditions.10 Stigma and systemic inequalities may undermine prevention efforts, increase levels of chronic and toxic stress, and ultimately sustain health and health care disparities.

Shared faith, family, and cultural institutions are common sources of social support. These institutions can empower and encourage individuals and communities to take actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, care for those who become sick, and help community members cope with stress. For example, families, churches and other groups in affected populations can help their communities face an epidemic by consulting CDC guidance documents for their organization type. The federal government is undertaking the following:  Collecting data to monitor and track disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the number of COVID-19 cases, complications, and deaths to share broadly and inform decisions on how to effectively address observed disparities. These data will be translated into information to improve the clinical management of patients, allocation of resources, and targeted public health information.

Providing clinical guidance and guidance to support actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in schools, workplaces and community settings, including those serving racial and ethnic minorities.  Public health professionals can do the following:  Ensure that communications about COVID-19 and its impact on different population groups is frequent, clear, transparent, and credible. Work with other sectors , such as faith and community education, business, transportation, and housing organizations, to share information and implement strategies to address social and economic barriers to implementing steps to slow the spread of COVID-19. Link more people among racial and ethnic minority groups to healthcare services for serious underlying medical conditions \u2014 for example, services to help them obtain necessary medications, follow treatment plans, or get testing and treatment if they have COVID-19 symptoms. Provide information forhealthcare professionals and health systems to understand cultural differences among patients and how patients interact with providers and the healthcare system. The National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (The National CLAS Standards) aim to improve health care quality and advance health equity by establishing a framework for organizations to serve the nation\u2019s increasingly diverse communities. Use evidence-based strategies to reduce health disparities. Those most vulnerable before an emergency are also the most vulnerable during and after an emergency.  Community organizations can do the following:  Prepare community health workers in underserved racial and ethnic minority communities to educate and link people to free or low-cost services. Prioritize resources for clinics, private practices, and other organizations that serve minority populations. Leverage effective health promotion programs in community, work, school, and home settings to disseminate recommendations and information about COVID-19. Work across sectors to connect people with services, such as grocery delivery or temporary housing, that help them practice social distancing. Connect people to healthcare providers and resources to help them get medications they may need.

Help combat the spread of rumors and misinformation by providing credible information from official sources.  Learn more about what community organizations can do. Healthcare systems and healthcare providers can do the following:   Implement standardized protocols in accordance with CDC guidance and quality improvement initiatives, especially in facilities that serve large minority populations.   Identify and address implicit bias that could hinder patient-provider interactions and communication.11   Provide medical interpretation services for patients who need them.

Recent reports of COVID-19 on cruise ships highlight the risk of infection to cruise ship passengers and crew. Like many other viruses, COVID-19 appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships.", "Rating": "Excellent", "Score": 4, "Average": 3.5}, {"Question": "Is it safe to go on a cruise during this pandemic?", "Answer": "Outbreaks of infectious diseases can happen on cruise ships because people spend time close together and with travelers from many countries. Disease can spread between ships when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer to other ships. Infected people may also travel on cruise ships between countries. For these reasons, outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships pose a risk for rapid spread of disease beyond the voyage and into communities across the globe. Because of the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risk of COVID-19 spread on cruise ships, the US government issued a No Sail Order for cruise ships in waters subject to US jurisdiction and has advised US travelers to defer all cruise travel. The No Sail Order is published in the Federal Register. CDC continues to work to control COVID-19 on cruise ships at sea while also protecting against further introduction and spread of COVID-19 into communities. The COVID-19 pandemic is constantly evolving, and aggressive efforts are needed to contain the spread. CDC will continue to evaluate and update our recommendations as the situation evolves. What is the No Sail Order? In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the increased risk of spread of COVID-19 on cruise ships, CDC published the first industry-wide No Sail Order on March 14 to prevent, among other things, new passengers from boarding cruise ships. CDC extended its No Sail Order, effective April 15, 2020, to continue to suspend all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. Among other things, cruise lines are required to develop comprehensive plans to prevent, detect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 on their cruise ships to protect the health and safety of both passengers and crew. How long is the No Sail Order in effect? The extended Order is in effect until one of the following occurs:  The Secretary of Health and Human Services declares that COVID-19 no longer constitutes a public health emergency, or The CDC Director rescinds or modifies the order based on specific public health or other considerations, or 100 days have passed from April 15, the date the extended order was published in the Federal Register and went into effect. 100 days from April 15 is July 24.  Why did CDC extend the No Sail Order? The No Sail Order was extended to protect the public, cruise ship passengers, cruise ship crews, and other industry workers. By restricting cruise ship passenger operations, the Order helps achieve several public health goals:  Prevents further spread of COVID-19 into and within the United States Preserves critical federal, state, and local resources that are needed to respond to COVID-19 Preserves critical healthcare, emergency, and port resources  What cruise ships does the No Sail Order cover? The No Sail Order applies to all cruise ships, which it defines as commercial passenger ships with the capacity to carry more than 250 people and where an overnight stay onboard by passengers or crew is anticipated. The Order applies to all cruise ships operating, or seeking to operate, in waters subject to US jurisdiction, including those that have previously voluntarily suspended operations. It does not apply to cargo ships. What does the No Sail Order mean for my upcoming trip? Passengers who plan to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line companies directly for further information. On March 17, 2020, CDC issued a Level 3 travel health notice with a clear recommendation to avoid all cruise travel due to ongoing spread of COVID-19 and the increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases on cruise ships. The No Sail Order suspends all cruise ship operations in waters subject to US jurisdiction. What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with crew still on board? We are currently in a phase of the pandemic where it is necessary to implement strict measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Just as the American public has a role to play in practicing social distancing, cruise lines have a role to play in properly caring for their crew, including making sure they can practice social distancing, isolating them if they are sick, and quarantining them if they have been exposed to COVID-19. CDC is committed to the safety and well-being of crew members while onboard and as they disembark. CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from cruise ships in U.S. waters and return home if cruise lines submit a signed attestation stating that they have complied with requirements to safely disembark their crew members. Crew members who remain onboard and want to disembark should contact their cruise ship or cruise line about meeting CDC requirements for safe disembarkation and transport. A list of disembarkations that CDC has approved is available here. Crew members on ships in or intending to be in US waters who have questions about the process for disembarkation or who have concerns about what their ship is doing to prevent COVID-19 onboard can share their questions or concerns with CDC by sending an email to eocevent431@cdc.gov. Cruise ships have medical facilities on board that can provide medical care to sick crew members as needed. As part of their cruise ship plans, cruise lines should make sure they have enough medical staff, equipment, supplies, and other resources to provide care for sick people on board. They also need a plan to transfer sick crew members to a hospital on land if they need medical care that the ship\u2019s medical facility can\u2019t provide. CDC and federal partners are monitoring ships with crew only, and we are working with the cruise companies and local and state health departments to ensure that seriously ill crew members can get medical assistance on land if the ship can\u2019t provide it. CDC remains committed to humanitarian medical evacuation for people in need of lifesaving support. Emergency medical evacuations do not require CDC approval. What is CDC doing to help cruise ships with passengers still on board? A small number of passengers are still aboard cruise ships in and around US waters. These passengers are awaiting repatriation to their home countries. CDC is working with partners as part of the Unified Command, including Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, port authorities, local and state health departments, and Department of State, along with cruise lines, to help remaining cruise ship passengers get home as quickly and safely as possible. These are cruise ships that had international voyages with U.S. ports, and therefore are under CDC jurisdiction. International voyages without U.S. ports of call are not under CDC jurisdiction and not included. International cruise voyages with U.S. domestic ports of call have been suspended since March 14, 2020, under CDC\u2019s No Sail Order.

It is expected that where providers already have a digital/electronic signature process, they must continue to utilise their existing processes in accordance with the respective funding rules above for 16 to 19, adults and apprenticeship learners. A wet signature is created when a person physically \u2018marks\u2019 a document.

The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not developed symptoms. A face covering can be very simple and may be worn in enclosed spaces where social distancing isn\u2019t possible. It just needs to cover your mouth and nose. It is not the same as a face mask, such as the surgical masks or respirators used by health and care workers. Similarly, face coverings are not the same as the PPE used to manage risks like dust and spray in an industrial context. Supplies of PPE, including face masks, must continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards. It is important to know that the evidence of the benefit of using a face covering to protect others is weak and the effect is likely to be small, therefore face coverings are not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk, including minimising time spent in contact, using fixed teams and partnering for close-up work, and increasing hand and surface washing. These other measures remain the best ways of managing risk in the workplace and government would therefore not expect to see employers relying on face coverings as risk management for the purpose of their health and safety assessments. Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by law, including in the workplace. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the purposes of identification. Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely if they choose to wear one. This means telling workers:  wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and after removing it when wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands change your face covering if it becomes damp or if you\u2019ve touched it continue to wash your hands regularly change and wash your face covering daily if the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

We would anticipate local authorities continuing to fund any contracted or commissioned providers, but where appropriate, providers may wish to consider accessing support measures for which they may be eligible to help them remain operational during this period, such as the business interruption loan schemes. Please refer to the respective guidance page as linked above for more information. As placements will continue to be needed, local authorities will continue to pay fees to children\u2019s social care providers. As these payments for essential services will continue, we would expect providers not to furlough staff, and for provision to remain available to support vulnerable children.

Signs may be emotional (for example, they may be upset, distressed, anxious, angry or agitated), behavioural (for example, they may become more clingy or more withdrawn, or they may wet the bed), or physical (for example, they may experience stomach aches). Look out for any changes in their behaviour. Children and young people may feel less anxious if they are able to express and communicate their feelings in a safe and supportive environment. Children and young people who communicate differently to their peers may rely on you to interpret their feelings. Listen to them, acknowledge their concern and give them extra love and attention if they need it. MindEd is a free online educational resource on children and young people\u2019s mental health for all adults, which can support parents and carers through these exceptional circumstances. Provide clear information about the situation: Children and young people want to feel assured that their parents and carers can keep them safe. One of the best ways to achieve this is by talking openly about what is happening and providing honest answers to any questions they have. Explain what is being done to keep them and their loved ones safe, including any actions they can take to help, such as washing their hands more often than usual. Use words and explanations that they can understand. There are resources available to help you do this, including the Children\u2019s Commissioner\u2019s Children\u2019s Guide to Coronavirus, or the Inter- Agency Standing Committee (IASC) have produced a storybook developed by and for children around the world affected by coronavirus (COVID-19). Make sure you use reliable sources of information such as GOV.UK or the NHS website \u2013 there is a lot of misleading information from other sources that can create stress for you and your family. It will not always be possible to provide answers to all the questions that children and young people may ask, or to address all their concerns, so focus on listening and acknowledging their feelings to help them feel supported. Be aware of your own reactions: Remember that children and young people often take their emotional cues from the important adults in their lives, so how you respond to the situation is very important. It is important to manage your own emotions and remain calm, listen to and acknowledge children and young people\u2019s concerns, speak kindly to them, and answer any questions they have honestly. For further information on how to look after your own mental wellbeing during the pandemic, see the guidance on how to look after your own mental health and wellbeing or visit Every Mind Matters. Connect regularly: If it is necessary for you and your children to be in different locations to normal (for example, due to staying at home in different locations or hospitalisation) make sure you still have regular and frequent contact via the phone or video calls with them. Try to help your child understand what arrangements are being made for them and why in simple terms. Support safe ways for children and young people to maintain social interaction with their friends, for example via phone or video calls. Create a new routine: Life is changing for all of us for a while. Routine gives children and young people an increased feeling of safety in the context of uncertainty, so think about how to develop a new routine, especially if they are not at school:  make a plan for the day or week that includes time for learning, playing and relaxing if they have to stay home from school, ask teachers what you can do to support continued learning at home. The Department for Education have published a list of recommended online educational resources for home schooling encourage maintaining a balance between being on and offline and discover new ideas for activities to do from home.

Plan time outside if you can do so safely or see Change4Life for ideas for indoor games and activities don\u2019t forget that sleep is important for mental and physical health, so try to keep to existing bedtime routines it may be tempting to give children and young people treats such as sweets or chocolate but this is not good for their health, especially as they may not be as physically active as normal. See Change4Life for ideas for healthy treats  Limit exposure to media and talk more about what they have seen and heard: Like adults, children and young people may become more distressed if they see repeated coverage about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the media. A complete news blackout is also rarely helpful as they are likely to find out from other sources, such as online or through friends. Try to avoid turning the television off or closing web pages when children or young people come into the room. This can peak their interest to find out what is happening and their imagination can take over. Instead, consider limiting the amount of exposure you and your family have to media coverage.

A brief summary of attendance expectations, across the different groups of vulnerable children and young people, is as follows:  for vulnerable children who have a social worker, attendance is encouraged where this is appropriate in line with the advice set out by Public Health England for vulnerable children who have an Education Health and Care (EHC) plan, attendance is encouraged where it is determined, following risk assessment, that their needs can be as safely, or more safely, met in the educational environment for vulnerable children who are deemed otherwise vulnerable, at the childcare setting, school or local authority\u2019s discretion, attendance is encouraged where this is appropriate  Educational providers, local authorities, social workers, parents/carers, and other relevant professionals (where applicable), should work together closely to consider factors, such as the balance of risk, including health vulnerabilities, family circumstances, risks outside the home, and the child or young person\u2019s assessed special educational needs.

This might include children on the edge of receiving support from children\u2019s social care services, adopted children, those at risk of becoming NEET (\u2018not in employment, education or training\u2019), those living in temporary accommodation, those who are young carers and others at the provider and local authority\u2019s discretion.  More information, including the expectations around attendance and encouraging attendance for different groups of vulnerable young people, can be found in Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. From the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, we will be asking colleges and other providers to invite increasing numbers of young people to return to on-site provision, alongside priority groups (vulnerable young people and children of critical workers). Special post-16 institutions will work towards a phased return of more young people without a focus on specific year groups. The government has set out guidance on staying alert and safe (social distancing) to help educational settings support safe provision for everyone who attends. Many colleges and other providers have already taken steps to support vulnerable young people, and the children of critical workers who cannot be supported elsewhere, and we are grateful to providers for the vital role they are playing in supporting the national response to coronavirus. Specifically, we are asking that colleges and other providers:   continue to provide a safe space and encourage attendance: Being in an educational setting can be an important lifeline for many vulnerable young people, particularly where their needs cannot be met safely at home or where they may be at risk of harm.   There is a continuing expectation now and throughout the period from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest that vulnerable young people \u2013 regardless of year group \u2013 will attend educational provision, where it is safe and appropriate for them do so.   From the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, young people in returning year groups \u2013 including vulnerable young people - are strongly encouraged to attend their educational setting where possible, unless they are ill, or guidance says they should not attend.   Providers are expected to follow the process set out on encouraging, enabling and monitoring attendance and following up on non-attendance, see Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.   We appreciate that decisions on attendance will likely be based on finely balanced discussions between the education provider, the parent/carer and others, including social workers, local authorities and other relevant professionals where applicable. The decision might be taken that the learner should attend the educational setting on a full-time or part-time basis, depending on the needs of the individual. We also appreciate that circumstances do change and therefore attendance decisions should be kept under review. For young people with an education, health and care (EHC) plan, colleges and other providers should ensure that existing risk assessments are up to date.   Where vulnerable young people are already attending educational settings, they should continue to do so. Where young people are currently not attending but attendance is appropriate, we expect providers and local authorities to consider how to encourage their attendance. If it is not possible for a vulnerable young person to attend a provider due to public transport routes being closed, then providers should speak to the local authority to consider what alternative transport arrangements could be put in place.   Make alternative arrangements: We are asking colleges and other providers that have been closed to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, so we expect the number of colleges and other providers that are closed to decline. However, in the meantime if a college or another provider is closed, the provider should notify the local authority/social worker. Providers should work with the local authority to ensure that the vulnerable young people who normally attend can be found a place in another educational setting. Providers can also contact their local ESFA team to discuss wider opening and which other local providers it may be possible for them to work with. Keep in contact with all vulnerable learners: As per the existing guidance on vulnerable children and young people, all vulnerable young people continue to be expected and encouraged to attend educational provision where it is appropriate for them to do so. Colleges and other providers which are currently closed are being asked to work towards wider opening from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest. However, where it is not safe for vulnerable learners to attend, or vulnerable learners cannot be persuaded to attend education settings, colleges and other providers should maintain regular communication with social workers, vulnerable leaners and their families to ensure they know where their vulnerable learners are and that they are safe. Colleges and other providers should continue to encourage attendance where appropriate. The frequency of contact required will depend on the individual\u2019s circumstances and needs and will be based on the assessment of risk. Social workers will remain in contact with vulnerable learners and their families, including remotely if needed.  Section 15 below is a collection of examples from providers who are successfully engaging vulnerable young people. It is intended to provide an opportunity for colleges and other providers to learn from each other\u2019s emerging practice and develop their approach to engaging vulnerable learners in education. Colleges and other providers should continue to comply with the Keeping children safe in education statutory guidance.

A face covering can be very simple and may be worn in enclosed spaces where social distancing isn\u2019t possible. It just needs to cover your mouth and nose. It is not the same as a face mask, such as the surgical masks or respirators used by health and care workers. Similarly, face coverings are not the same as the PPE used to manage risks like dust and spray in an industrial context. Supplies of PPE, including face masks, must continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards. It is important to know that the evidence of the benefit of using a face covering to protect others is weak and the effect is likely to be small, therefore face coverings are not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk, including minimising time spent in contact, using fixed teams and partnering for close-up work, and increasing hand and surface washing. These other measures remain the best ways of managing risk in the workplace and government would therefore not expect to see employers relying on face coverings as risk management for the purpose of their health and safety assessments. Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by law, including in the workplace. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off. Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely if they choose to wear one. This means telling workers:  wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and after removing it when wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands change your face covering if it becomes damp or if you\u2019ve touched it continue to wash your hands regularly change and wash your face covering daily if the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

How best can I limit my risk of infection and exposure to other people?", "Answer": "If you can, wear a face covering in enclosed public spaces where social distancing isn\u2019t possible and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas, for example, on public transport or in some shops. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the purposes of identification. Evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you. However, if you are infected but have not yet developed symptoms, it may provide some protection for others you come into close contact with. Face coverings do not replace social distancing. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, and/or high temperature, and/or loss of, or change in, your normal sense of smell or taste - anosmia), you and your household must isolate at home: wearing a face covering does not change this. A face covering is not the same as the surgical masks or respirators used by healthcare and other workers as part of personal protective equipment.

A child\u2019s parent, or a young person, has a right to request a personal budget when the local authority has completed an education health and care needs assessment and confirmed that it will prepare an EHC plan.

Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to socially distance, where possible. The actions the HSE can take include the provision of specific advice to employers through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.

Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to socially distance, where possible. The actions the HSE can take include the provision of specific advice to employers through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.

Staying at home will help control the spread of the virus to friends, the wider community, and particularly the most vulnerable. Those with symptoms should remain at home for at least 7 days after the onset of their symptoms as set out in the stay-at-home guidance. This will reduce the risk of you infecting others. If one of you has symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus, then household members must also stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days as set out in the stay-at-home guidance and the ending household isolation section below. You should not go out even to buy food or other essentials unless you have no other means to secure them, and any exercise should be taken within your home. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in your house became ill. If you are having food or other essentials delivered to your house, the person who is delivering the items should not come into your home. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community.

In this section  1.1 Managing risk 1.2 Sharing the results of your risk assessment  Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks.

The department\u2019s advice about emergency situations is if your journey is necessary to enable someone to: 1) provide goods or services to protect public health, and/or 2) meet their or others\u2019 basic needs for day to day living, and/or 3) provide medical treatment and there is a risk of danger to the life or health of people if your journey is not carried out; then you should make use of the emergency exemption.

Drivers will, however, remain subject to all other requirements of the Working Time Regulations in an emergency event. The practical implementation of any changes should be through agreement between employers, employees and (where available) driver representatives. Employers must, where possible, agree any extension of working time with employees or other workers, before that work starts. The drivers in question must note on the back of their tachograph charts or printouts the reasons why they are exceeding the normally permitted limits. This is usual practice in emergencies and is, of course, essential for enforcement purposes.

Think about how you can stay in touch with friends and family via telephone, video calls or social media instead of meeting in person \u2013 whether it\u2019s people you normally see often or connecting with old friends. Help and support others: Think about how you could help those around you \u2013 it could make a big difference to them and can make you feel better too. Could you message a friend or family member nearby? Are there community groups that you could join to support others locally? Remember it\u2019s important to do this in line with guidance on coronavirus (COVID-19) to keep yourself and everyone safe. And try to be accepting of other people\u2019s concerns, worries or behaviours. Talk about your worries: It is quite common to feel worried, scared or helpless about the current situation. Remember that this is a difficult time for everyone and sharing how you are feeling and the things you are doing to cope with family and friends can help them too. If you don\u2019t feel able to do that, there are people you can speak to via NHS recommended helplines or you could find support groups online to connect with. Look after your physical wellbeing: Your physical health has a big impact on how you are feeling emotionally and mentally. At times like these, it can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse. Try to eat healthy, well-balanced meals, drink enough water, exercise inside where possible and outside once a day, and try to avoid smoking, alcohol and drugs. If you are able to go outside, consider walking or gardening (keeping the recommended 2 metres from others as outlined in the social distancing guidance). If you are staying at home, you can find free easy 10 minute work outs from Public Health England or other exercise videos to try at home on the NHS Fitness Studio. Sport England also has good tips for keeping active at home. Look after your sleep: Feeling anxious or worried can make it harder to get a good night\u2019s sleep. Good-quality sleep makes a big difference to how you feel mentally and physically, so it\u2019s important to get enough. Try to maintain regular sleeping patterns and keep good sleep hygiene practices \u2013 like avoiding screens before bed, cutting back on caffeine and creating a restful environment. The Every Mind Matters sleep page provides practical advice on how to improve your sleep. Try to manage difficult feelings: Many people find the news about coronavirus (COVID-19) concerning. However, some people may experience such intense anxiety that it becomes a problem. Try to focus on the things you can control, including where you get information from and actions to make yourself feel better prepared. It is okay to acknowledge some things that are outside of your control right now but constant repetitive thoughts about the situation which lead you to feel anxious or overwhelmed are not helpful. The Every Mind Matters page on anxiety and NHS mental wellbeing audio guides provide further information on how to manage anxiety. Manage your media and information intake: 24-hour news and constant social media updates can make you more worried. If it is affecting you, try to limit the time you spend watching, reading, or listening to media coverage of the outbreak. It may help to only check the news at set times or limiting to a couple of checks a day. Get the facts: Gather high-quality information that will help you to accurately determine your own or other people\u2019s risk of contracting coronavirus (COVID-19) so that you can take reasonable precautions. Find a credible source you can trust such as GOV.UK, or the NHS website, and fact check information that you get from newsfeeds, social media or from other people. Think about how possibly inaccurate information could affect others too. Try not to share information without fact-checking against credible sources. Think about your new daily routine: Life is changing for us all for a while. Whether you are staying at home or social distancing, you are likely to see some disruption to your normal routine. Think about how you can adapt and create positive new routines \u2013 try to engage in useful activities (such as cleaning, cooking or exercise) or meaningful activities (such as reading or calling a friend). You might find it helpful to write a plan for your day or your week. Do things you enjoy: When you are anxious, lonely or low you may do things that you usually enjoy less often, or not at all. Focussing on your favourite hobby, learning something new or simply taking time to relax indoors should give you some relief from anxious thoughts and feelings and can boost your mood. If you can\u2019t do the things you normally enjoy because you are staying at home, try to think about how you could adapt them, or try something new. There are lots of free tutorials and courses online and people are coming up with innovative online solutions like online pub quizzes and streamed live music concerts. Set goals: Setting goals and achieving them gives a sense of control and purpose \u2013 think about things you want or need to do that you can still do at home. It could be watching a film, reading a book or learning something online. Keep your mind active: Read, write, play games, do crossword puzzles, sudokus, jigsaws or drawing and painting. Find something that works for you. Take time to relax and focus on the present: This can help with difficult emotions, worries about the future, and can improve wellbeing. Relaxation techniques can also help some people to deal with feelings of anxiety. For useful resources see Every Mind Matters and NHS\u2019 mindfulness page.

Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks.

Everyone needs to assess and manage the risks of COVID-19. As an employer, you also have a legal responsibility to protect workers and others from risk to their health and safety. This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to socially distance, where possible. The actions the HSE can take include the provision of specific advice to employers through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.

It can include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory protective equipment, such as face masks. Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non- COVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so. At the start of this document we described the steps you need to take to manage COVID-19 risk in the workplace. This includes working from home and staying 2m away from each other in the workplace if at all possible. When managing the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE. The exception is clinical settings, like a hospital, or a small handful of other roles for which Public Health England advises use of PPE. For example, first responders and immigration enforcement officers. If you are in one of these groups you should refer to the advice at:  COVID-19: personal protective equipment (PPE) plan COVID-19: cleaning in non-healthcare settings  Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra PPE to protect against COVID-19 outside clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. Unless you are in a situation where the risk of COVID-19 transmission is very high, your risk assessment should reflect the fact that the role of PPE in providing additional protection is extremely limited. However, if your risk assessment does show that PPE is required, then you must provide this PPE free of charge to workers who need it. Any PPE provided must fit properly. [PPE]: Personal protective equipment   [COVID-19]: coronavirus", "Rating": "Acceptable", "Score": 3, "Average": 2.625}, {"Question": "What can I do to keep my customers and visitors safe in my factory?", "Answer": "There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure. The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not developed symptoms. A face covering can be very simple and may be worn in enclosed spaces where social distancing isn\u2019t possible. It just needs to cover your mouth and nose. It is not the same as a face mask, such as the surgical masks or respirators used by health and care workers. Similarly, face coverings are not the same as the PPE used to manage risks like dust and spray in an industrial context. Supplies of PPE, including face masks, must continue to be reserved for those who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers, and those in industrial settings like those exposed to dust hazards. It is important to know that the evidence of the benefit of using a face covering to protect others is weak and the effect is likely to be small, therefore face coverings are not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk, including minimising time spent in contact, using fixed teams and partnering for close-up work, and increasing hand and surface washing. These other measures remain the best ways of managing risk in the workplace and government would therefore not expect to see employers relying on face coverings as risk management for the purpose of their health and safety assessments. Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by law, including in the workplace. If you choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash your hands before putting them on and taking them off. You should be prepared to remove your face covering if asked to do so by police officers and staff for the purposes of identification. Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely if they choose to wear one. This means telling workers:  wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and after removing it when wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands change your face covering if it becomes damp or if you\u2019ve touched it continue to wash your hands regularly change and wash your face covering daily if the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturer\u2019s instructions; if it\u2019s not washable, dispose of it carefully in your usual waste practise social distancing wherever possible  You can make face-coverings at home.

Steps that will usually be needed:   Providing handwashing and hand sanitiser and encourage visitors to wash their hands regularly.   Regulating entry so that the premises do not become overcrowded, and placing 2m markers on the floor to maintain social distancing inside the premises.   Providing clear guidance on social distancing and hygiene to people on arrival, for example, signage, visual aids and before arrival, such as by phone, on the website or by email.   Determining if schedules for essential services and contractor visits can be revised to reduce interaction and overlap between people, for example, carrying out services at night.   4.1.1 Selling food or drink Objective: To minimise interactions with outside workers and the public when selling food or drinks. Steps that will usually be needed:   Minimising contact between kitchen workers and front of house workers, delivery drivers or riders, for example, by having zones from which delivery drivers can collect packaged food items.   Using front of house staff to serve customers purchasing food and drink, minimising the time they spend in the kitchen.   Creating a physical barrier such as a screen, between front of house workers and customers where possible.   Encouraging contactless payments where possible.   Limiting access to premises for people waiting for or collecting takeaways. Setting out clear demarcation for 2m distances for customers queuing. Asking customers to wait in their cars.   Asking customers to order online, on apps or over the telephone to reduce queues and stagger pick up times.   Making regular announcements to remind customers to follow social distancing advice and clean their hands regularly.   4.2 Providing and explaining available guidance Objective: To make sure people understand what they need to do to maintain safety. Steps that will usually be needed:   Displaying clearly to customers the social distancing guidelines in place.   Where site visits are required, for example, inbound supplier deliveries or safety critical visitors, providing site guidance on social distancing and hygiene on or before arrival.   Reviewing entry and exit routes for customers, visitors and contractors to minimise contact with other people.

Around one in four women in the UK has a caesarean birth. A caesarean may be recommended as a planned (elective) procedure for medical reasons or as an emergency \u2013 for example, if doctors and midwives are concerned that your baby is not coping with labour and needs to be born immediately. Furthermore, around one in five women in the UK has an instrumental birth (ventouse or forceps). Some of these types of birth may also be recommended to occur in an operating theatre in order to allow the maternity team to modify plans and undertake a caesarean birth if necessary. Most caesareans and instrumental births in theatre are carried out under spinal or epidural anaesthetic, which means you\u2019ll be awake, but the lower part of your body is numb and you cannot feel any pain. In this situation, everything will be done by the clinical staff \u2013 midwives, obstetricians and anaesthetists \u2013 to keep your birth partner with you. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, staff in the operating theatre will be wearing enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of infection, which will make it more difficult for them to communicate. To enable the clinicians to assist in the birth of your baby safely, it\u2019s really important your birth partner follows the instructions from the maternity team carefully and quickly. Occasionally, a general anaesthetic (where you\u2019re put to sleep) may be used, particularly if your baby needs to be born urgently. During this type of caesarean birth, even under more usual circumstances, for safety reasons it is not possible for the birth partner to be present during the birth. While the maternity team will do all they can to ensure that your birth partner is present for the birth, there will be some occasions when there is a need for an urgent emergency birth with epidural or spinal anaesthetic, and it will not be possible for your birth partner to be present.

If your organisation is a registered charity, see the Charity Commission guidance on how charities can help while keeping within their objects. FE and sixth form college corporations which are helping the national effort in ways other than education, such as giving surplus food to a food bank or allowing key workers to use unoccupied student accommodation, are to be applauded for contributing in this way.

For providers who recruit learners later in the year rather than purely at the beginning of the academic year, and whose enrolment of new learners in the summer term will have ceased, we will determine a way to ensure this does not have an unfairly detrimental impact on future allocations. For example, we could still apply the current approach of identifying what proportion of student numbers were recruited after we take the initial data return in the autumn but use full year data from 2018/19. Student prior attainment in English and/or maths GCSEs Three elements within the 16 to 19 funding formula use students\u2019 prior attainment in English and/or maths, namely:  the condition of funding disadvantage funding - block 2 level 3 programme maths and English payment  We anticipate that these will continue to be calculated as now following the alternative plans that have now been published to award grades to students in the absence of GCSE exams this summer, and so providers will still be allocated additional funding for young people with low prior attainment in GCSE English or maths. As further details are published for how the replacement for exams will work, we will consider these elements in more detail. Funding to prepare for and deliver T levels Allocations have been made to providers who will be delivering the first wave of T levels in 2020 to 2021 based on planned T level student numbers. We have already published the approach for applying a tolerance where enrolment of T level students is below the planned number. Due to the lagged student number approach, where the level of T level students recruited means the tolerance would be implemented, only the numbers above the tolerance would be converted to a full-time band 5 student. Read more about the tolerance in the How T levels will be funded in 2020 to 2021 guidance. We will monitor the suitability of this approach over the coming months as we get nearer to the introduction of T levels. Industry Placement Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF) 2019 to 2020 The unprecedented impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) has meant that it is currently extremely difficult for providers to continue to organise and deliver industry placements through the Capacity and Delivery Fund (CDF). Given these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, providers will not be penalised for missing specific CDF industry placement targets this academic year. Funding will not be clawed back if providers can demonstrate how the funding has and will continue to support your work on industry placement delivery. We want to make sure that providers are able to maximise the activity that they are able to carry out during this period to continue to support the delivery of placements, and to prepare to deliver placements in 2020 to 2021. Activities we would expect to continue to go ahead:  continuing to build relationships with employers and developing engagement strategies for different industries preparing students for placements (such as through virtual training for work programmes) ensuring alignment between curriculum planning and industry placement provision developing matching processes for when students can go on placements again  We will ask for evidence of this through the usual autumn CDF monitoring process in order to minimise reporting burdens, and we will still look to claw back funding under the usual arrangements should providers fail to demonstrate they have continued to support the delivery of industry placements. Providers must avoid the risk of double funding. We will seek to claw back funding should providers furlough staff involved in these activities.

This will primarily impact schools and colleges, but will also include a small number of Local Authority providers, specialist post-16 institutions and independent training providers. We understand that there may need to be some flexibility in place due to the variety of learners and courses offered in FE settings, therefore:  although the main face to face contact is for 16 to 19 learners, there may be some courses that include learners within a class that are over 19 some 16 to 19-year-olds will have been due to finish this academic year, but not been able to because their assessments have been deferred (typically where they involve a license to practice). These learners can be included in on-site delivery if they would benefit from face to face contact; we will be expecting colleges and providers to treat 16 to 19-year-old apprentices consistently with other learners for their off the job training where possible and appropriate, so that they can be offered some face to face contact; in addition to colleges, this guidance also applies to the smaller proportion of 16 to 19 learners in other further education settings \u2013 including Local Authority delivery, Special Post-16 Designated Institutions and independent providers  In order to determine what level of attendance is appropriate within any of the options stated above, colleges and other providers should conduct risk assessments in order to understand:  the number of learners and staff likely to be included in a learning space whether they can be safely accommodated in accordance with guidance to implement protective measures the availability of teaching and non-teaching staff and required ratios, including contingency plans should individuals be shielding or self-isolating supporting services required in increasing the number of individuals on-site (for example, catering) and how they can be safely provided what measures in addition to those that have already been undertaken during the current lockdown will need to be in place to accommodate additional numbers (including additional cleaning required of spaces and equipment following use)  Learners will need to stay within their new class/group wherever possible and we will ask settings to implement a range of protective measures including increased cleaning, reducing \u2018pinch points\u2019 (such as at the start and end of day), and utilising outdoor space. Any additional costs arising from wider opening, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) will be funded from existing college budgets. Staff and learners will be eligible for testing if they become ill with coronavirus symptoms, as will members of their households. A negative test will enable learners and staff to get back to their education. A positive test will ensure rapid action to protect their classmates and staff in their setting. Those who are clinically vulnerable, or are living with someone who is, should follow our protective measures guidance. In line with implementing protective measures and reducing contacts, colleges and other providers should limit the attendance of learners in the setting at any one time and keep learners in small groups. They should also consider ways to minimise use of public transport to get to and from the FE provider at peak times in consultation with local authorities. We will be consulting with sector representatives in order to develop some \u2018models\u2019 of how this could operate, and this will be published along with further guidance for secondary schools and colleges and other providers in the week commencing 18 May. The Department\u2019s guidance on implementing protective measures in education and childcare settings contains detailed advice on:  cleaning, including supplies of cleaning and handwashing products testing and tracing PPE what settings should do in response to a case of coronavirus being confirmed  We recognise that for some programmes, online learning will be working effectively with a high degree of learner engagement (while some families may, for example, include family members who are shielding and therefore learners are not able to physically attend). Colleges and other providers will have flexibility to decide the appropriate mix of online and face to face content for each programme, reflecting what will maximise learner engagement as well as supporting more vulnerable learners, and enabling the provider as a whole to minimise transmission risk. For 16 to 19-year-old learners eligible to return, in balancing on-site and online delivery, colleges may consider the following issues:  Which learners are most at risk of disengagement through online learning (typically at lower academic levels). Learners that require on-site provision in order to undertake technical instruction which requires the use of equipment. The impact on the risk of transmission (for example it may be easier to undertake instruction in outside settings or larger spaces). Some types of vocational instruction may be more challenging where they by their nature involve personal contact. Where online learning is working well with high engagement, colleges may wish to maintain a larger element of online delivery.

Private landlords and letting agents should not conduct viewings in properties where tenants are symptomatic or self-isolating, or where it has been determined that they are clinically extremely vulnerable and are shielding. In other cases, where viewings can proceed, they should be conducted in line with the guidance on viewings earlier in this document. Any visits to a property must be made in accordance with government\u2019s guidelines on working in other people\u2019s homes and social distancing. If possible, necessary repairs, gas and electrical safety checks should be conducted in the period between a property being vacated and a new tenant moving in. If this is not possible and visits are needed to an occupied property, this should be done by appointment with measures put in place to ensure physical contact is minimised, for example with residents staying in another room during the visit. Landlords should make every effort to abide by gas and electrical safety requirements, which continue to be of great importance for tenants\u2019 safety. This may be more difficult due to restrictions associated with the coronavirus outbreak, for example where a tenant has coronavirus symptoms, is self-isolating or shielding. Under such circumstances, provided the landlord can demonstrate they have taken reasonable steps to comply, they would not be in breach. See further Health and Safety Executive guidance on how to deal with specific circumstances. Letting agents may also want to consider obtaining landlord and tenant consent for inventory clerk appointments to also occur before a tenant moves in or after a tenant moves out during vacant periods if possible. Letting agents and landlords should take steps to ensure any properties are prepared ready for new tenants, this may include cleaning to minimise any potential spread of the virus in line with government advice. Letting agents and landlords should consider how best to conduct tenancy check-ins for new tenancies agreed while broader measures remain in place, taking care to follow government advice on social distancing to minimise possible spread of coronavirus. Letting agents and landlords are reminded of the temporary COVID-19 measures that adjust right to rent checks, temporarily allowing these checks to be conducted remotely. Lettings agents and landlords should consider other areas where in person payments, referencing or checks can be conducted remotely instead and take further advice if required.

Childminders are less likely to be employers, and therefore are less likely to be eligible for support via the CJRS. Childminders may find the Self Employment Income Support Scheme more relevant. Maintained nursery schools should take account of the guidance in this section. For school-based nursery provision, please refer to the \u2018schools\u2019 section below. On 17 March 2020, the Chancellor confirmed that the government will continue to pay local authorities for free early years entitlement places for 2, 3 and 4 year olds to support providers at this time. On 18 March 2020, the government also announced a business rates holiday for many nurseries in England for the 2020 to 2021 tax year. Read the guidance. Early years settings should remain open where they are needed to provide childcare for the children of critical workers who cannot be cared for safely at home, and vulnerable children. A private provider should only furlough employees, and therefore seek support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, if they meet the following conditions:  the employee works in an area of business where services are temporarily not required and where their salary is not covered by public funding the employee would otherwise be made redundant or laid off the employee is not involved in delivering provision that has already been funded (free entitlement funding) (where appropriate) the employee is not required to deliver provision for a child of a critical worker and/or vulnerable child the grant from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme would not duplicate other public grants received, and would not lead to financial reserves being created  If it is difficult to distinguish whether staff are funded through free entitlement or private income for the purposes of meeting the first 3 conditions as listed above, then an early years provider can access the CJRS to cover up to the proportion of its paybill which could be considered to have been paid for from that provider\u2019s private income. This would typically be income received from \u2018parent-paid\u2019 hours, and excludes all income from the government\u2019s free entitlements (or \u2018DSG income\u2019) for all age groups. In line with the conditions of the scheme listed above, providers should initially use the month of February 2020 to represent their usual income in calculating the proportion of its paybill eligible to be covered by the scheme. Providers should adjust these proportions in subsequent furloughing applications if their income from the government\u2019s free entitlements changes, but are not expected to make any adjustments in relation to changes in parent-paid income. To illustrate: If a provider\u2019s average monthly income is 40% from DSG and 60% from other income, the provider could claim CJRS support for up to 60% of their paybill. This would be done by furloughing staff whose usual salary / combined salaries come to no greater than 60% of the provider\u2019s total paybill. These proportions could change in subsequent furlough applications as a result of DSG income changing (but not where income from parents increased or decreased). For example, if this provider subsequently receives additional DSG income from a local authority as a result of providing additional hours of childcare, such that its new DSG income would represent 55% of its total income in February 2020, then its maximum use of the furlough scheme should, from that point, be reduced to 45% of its paybill. Some early years settings may also be eligible for the Small Business Grant Fund (SBGF). The details and eligibility criteria for SBGF can be found in the guidance.

The supplier relief guidance covers the length of existing live assignments up to the end date that had been previously agreed. It does not require these assignments to be extended further if the resource will not be required. Where agency workers are not on live assignments with schools, or where a previously agreed assignment is due to end, schools and agencies should discuss any further demand for the worker. If there is no further demand, the employer can apply to furlough the worker via the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Once a worker has been furloughed, they become unavailable to work and cannot provide services for their employer for a minimum of 3 weeks. Schools and agencies should bear this in mind when discussing ongoing resource requirements and agencies should keep this under regular review.

Because the transmission rate of coronavirus (COVID-19) has decreased, we anticipate that with further progress, from the week commencing 1 June at the earliest, more 16-19 learners in key assessment years, in addition to vulnerable learners and the children of critical workers, will be able to attend further education settings. We are therefore asking schools, colleges and childcare providers to plan on this basis. Provision would also continue for:  vulnerable learners (as defined) children of critical workers (as defined) in any year group colleges are also asked to work towards provision for certain groups of learners, as identified in the Maintaining education and skills training provision: further education providers guidance published by the Department for Education.  This checklist is intended to provide support to colleges preparing their short term response to increasing attendance and face-to-face contact for some groups of learners. The list is not exclusive and should be seen as a set of guiding principles for college leaders and governing bodies to assist their decision making when approving their detailed plans for extending attendance of learners in their college. The checklist outlines considerations that need to be taken account of in order to ensure that appropriate assessment of risk has been taken to secure the safety of learners and staff, as well as ensuring that due consideration has been given to any wider impact on the college\u2019s area and community. Implementation of the checklist may well have financial implications; care must be exercised to ensure these are taken into account with due regard for the impact on the college\u2019s overall budget and financial position. Regular updates should be provided to the Education and Skills Funding Agency ESFA territorial teams as appropriate. Given the varied nature of colleges it is not possible for the government to be prescriptive and provide a blueprint that could apply to every college. A tailored approach, within these guiding principles, will be required to ensure an approach that is practicable, safe and which meets, as far as is possible, the needs of the learners, staff and wider community. This guidance will not be exhaustive and there may be particular circumstances which necessitate the consideration of factors not covered here. It is recognised that many college leaders and boards have already been scenario planning for this eventuality, taking measures to risk assess and prepare in general terms, whilst awaiting further detail of proposals. This guidance aims to further assist preparations. Guidance documents that this should be read in conjunction with this are:  Safe working in education, childcare and children\u2019s social care Supporting vulnerable children and young people during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak Coronavirus (COVID-19): safeguarding in schools, colleges and other providers Keeping Children Safe in Education 2019 Working Together to Safeguard Children  In addition the following documents published on 11 May provide updated information:  Press notice Actions for educational and childcare settings Implementing protective measures in education childcare settings Information for parents and carers  Further guidance will be published as appropriate.

This approach, which reflects the complexity and scale of the DfE\u2019s commercial arrangements, is intended to provide you with some overarching guidance and principles as to how you could choose to implement the PPN.  stage 1: Assessment of whether the supplier has considered other measures announced by the government: This involves asking if they have explored and applied for, as applicable, all other forms of support available to them, including the wider government business support schemes. This is to avoid duplication of funding, such as providing both supplier relief under PPN 02/20 and payment of related workers that have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) stage 2: Assessment of whether they are a critical supplier to your organisation: The main consideration here is whether you feel the supplier provides services, goods or works that are critical in the medium and long term, and are important to business continuity to provide relief against the contract stage 3: Assessment of whether the supplier is financially \u2018at risk\u2019 as a result of COVID-19: In principle, a supplier is deemed at risk where they are unable to fulfil the contractual obligations of a contract due to COVID-19 and are experiencing financial difficulties as a result stage 4: Commercial interventions to manage supplier: It is important that commercial judgement is used when considering the type of support available pursuant to the PPN, which could include:  payments for previously anticipated volumes (even if not met), or for the advanced order of materials where appropriate continuing to pay for services to suppliers who give their best endeavours to continue delivery despite performance being somewhat affected considering an extension of time for contract performance (for example, revised milestones or delivery dates) adjusting agreed lead times which despite best endeavours might not be met by suppliers and ensure their payments are not negatively affected by that consider supplementing service delivery through your own resources, though this is likely to be difficult, but may help alleviate the challenges the supplier is suffering as a result of COVID-19   stage 5: Financial interventions: As with the commercial interventions, financial judgement should be used when considering any of the suggested options below:  variation of payment mechanism - specifically beneficial where contracts are based upon the delivery of outcomes or outputs, you can vary the payment mechanisms to provide greater short term cash flow to the supplier, for example, moving from payments on delivery of services, works or goods to aligning payments to the costs being incurred by the supplier, or breaking down milestone payments into multiple smaller payments increasing speed of payment - this PPN seeks to expedite this process and adjust normal financial controls, such as paying reconciled invoices before their due date prepayment of up to 25% of contract value - this specifically targets immediate cash flow issues, but potentially creates a cash flow issue at a later date in the contract, so should be considered accordingly. For example, releasing a proportion of retained funds on capital projects, ahead of actual defects being identified and remedied    It is important that any commercial or financial changes or variations to contracts should be agreed in accordance with the change control clauses contained in the contracts, and documented, even if this takes place retrospectively. The Cabinet Office has developed a series of model clauses pertaining to COVID-19. There are a number of other important points to note when considering how best to implement PPN 02/20 for your organisation:  whatever approach you decide best meets your needs, you need to ensure you apply the necessary financial and governance controls applicable to your organisation the PPN is very clear about the importance of transparency, and suppliers agreeing to act on an open book basis and make cost data available to you during this period, so please ensure they do so where relevant keeping a record of your agreed approach and supporting rationale, along with details of any payments made, assessment of risks or contractual changes, is important to show that you have an audit trail.

Maintained nursery schools should refer to the early years section above. Mainstream state-funded schools Local authority maintained schools (including pupil referral units) and academies (including free schools) will continue to receive their budgets for the coming year, as usual, regardless of any periods of partial or complete closure. That will ensure that they are able to continue to pay their staff, and meet their other regular financial commitments, as we move through these extraordinary times. We know that schools may face additional costs as a result of coronavirus (COVID-19). We have put in place additional support to help schools meet these costs; guidance is available on this additional funding. We do not, in general, expect schools to furlough staff. However, we understand that, in some instances, schools may have a separate private income stream (for example, catering, sports facilities lettings, or boarding provision funded by parents in state boarding schools). Where this income has either stopped or been reduced and there are staff that are typically paid from those private income streams, it may be appropriate to furlough staff. Schools should first seek to make the necessary savings from their existing budget or consider options to redeploy these staff before furloughing them. Only after all other potential options have been fully considered should schools furlough those members of staff and seek support through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. The following conditions need to be met:  the employee works in an area of business where services are temporarily not required and whose salary is not covered by public funding the employee would otherwise be made redundant or laid off \u2022 the employee is not involved in delivering provision that has already been funded (where appropriate) the employee is not required to deliver provision for a child of a critical worker and/or vulnerable child the grant from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme would not duplicate other public grants received and would not lead to financial reserves being created  Where these conditions are met, schools should receive a grant from the CJRS which is in line with the proportion of its paybill which could be considered to have been funded by a school\u2019s private income. To illustrate: If a school\u2019s average monthly private income stream (for example, from parent- paid school meals) provides 4% of the schools\u2019 overall income, the school could claim support through the CJRS for up to 4% of its paybill, after exhausting options to meet costs from existing budgets and redeployment This would be done by furloughing staff (for example, catering staff) whose usual salary or combined salaries are linked with the income lost and come to no greater than 4% of the provider\u2019s total paybill. Schools are not expected to consider each stream of private income separately so a school should consider its total income from private sources, as a proportion of its overall income, and the pay of all the staff it proposes to furlough, as a proportion of its total paybill. The DfE is considering appropriate measures to monitor the use of this scheme in order to detect any duplication of funding, and will be considering potential options to recover misused public funding as required.

This means you need to think about the risks they face and do everything reasonably practicable to minimise them, recognising you cannot completely eliminate the risk of COVID-19. You must make sure that the risk assessment for your business addresses the risks of COVID-19, using this guidance to inform your decisions and control measures. A risk assessment is not about creating huge amounts of paperwork, but rather about identifying sensible measures to control the risks in your workplace. If you have fewer than 5 workers, or are self-employed, you don\u2019t have to write anything down as part of your risk assessment. Your risk assessment will help you decide whether you have done everything you need to. The Health and Safety Executive has guidance for business on how to manage risk and risk assessment at work along with specific advice to help control the risk of coronavirus in workplaces. Employers have a duty to consult their people on health and safety. You can do this by listening and talking to them about the work and how you will manage risks from COVID-19. The people who do the work are often the best people to understand the risks in the workplace and will have a view on how to work safely. Involving them in making decisions shows that you take their health and safety seriously. You must consult with the health and safety representative selected by a recognised trade union or, if there isn\u2019t one, a representative chosen by workers. As an employer, you cannot decide who the representative will be. At its most effective, full involvement of your workers creates a culture where relationships between employers and workers are based on collaboration, trust and joint problem solving. As is normal practice, workers should be involved in assessing workplace risks and the development and review of workplace health and safety policies in partnership with the employer. Employers and workers should always come together to resolve issues. If concerns still cannot be resolved, see below for further steps you can take. Where the enforcing authority, such as the HSE or your local authority, identifies employers who are not taking action to comply with the relevant public health legislation and guidance to control public health risks, they will consider taking a range of actions to improve control of workplace risks. For example, this would cover employers not taking appropriate action to socially distance, where possible. The actions the HSE can take include the provision of specific advice to employers through to issuing enforcement notices to help secure improvements.

The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact. You are very unlikely to be infected from walking past another person. Public Health England (PHE) recommends trying to keep 2 metres away from people, where possible, as a precaution. However, this is not a rule and the science is complex. The key thing is to not be too close to people for more than a short amount of time, as much as you can. Employers should advise staff and passengers on ways of working to keep their distance from other people as much as possible. There are situations where this may not be possible, for example when boarding or alighting, during security checks, on busier services, busier times of day, when walking through interchanges and when undertaking maintenance work that requires two people for the task. Where social distancing is not possible try to minimise the time spent within 2 metres of others, and keep groups of workers in teams that are as small as possible (\u201ccohorting\u201d). For example, keeping maintenance crews working together, rather than mixing crew members on different shifts. Organisations could consider:  Creating and agreeing a single, clear approach to social distancing for all workers and passengers.  Agreeing and maintaining clear rules for workers and passengers that meet social distancing guidelines, for example:  Clear rules for interacting with passengers, receiving goods, and testing equipment. Support individual workers who choose to use face coverings in situations where social distancing is not possible.  Organising the workspace and how people work in a single space to follow social distancing guidelines, such as:   Separating workspaces 2 metres apart from one another, where possible.  Use of screens or barriers. Eliminating face-to-face seating, for example, shift to \u2018bench\u2019 style. Repositioning workspaces to allow for optimal ventilation. Reducing occupancy of group interaction spaces, including spaces shared with other organisations. Adjustments for those with specific needs or protected characteristics, for example disabled people, the elderly and pregnant women. Consider groups of people who process information differently or who may not be able to distance from others.    Workplaces should not encourage the precautionary use of extra personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect against coronavirus outside of clinical settings or when responding to a suspected or confirmed case. Where you are already using PPE in your work activity to protect against non- COVID-19 risks, you should continue to do so. When managing the risk of COVID-19, additional PPE beyond what you usually wear is not beneficial. This is because COVID-19 is a different type of risk to the risks you normally face in a workplace, and needs to be managed through social distancing, hygiene and fixed teams or partnering, not through the use of PPE. There are some circumstances when wearing a face covering may be marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure. The evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not protect you, but it may protect others if you are infected but have not yet developed symptoms. This is most relevant for short periods indoors in crowded areas. Government guidance is for passengers, if they can, to wear a face covering if they need to use public transport.

Wearing a face covering is optional and is not required by the law. If workers choose to wear one, it is important to use face coverings properly and wash hands before putting them on and taking them off. Use the guidance on face coverings. If workers choose to use face coverings, you should support them in using face coverings safely. For example:  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or use hand sanitiser before putting a face covering on, and after removing it. When wearing a face covering, avoid touching your face or face covering, as you could contaminate them with germs from your hands. Change your face covering if it becomes damp or if you\u2019ve touched it. Continue to wash your hands regularly. Change and wash your face covering daily. If the material is washable, wash in line with manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If it\u2019s not washable, dispose of it in your usual waste. Practise social distancing wherever possible.

They are funded in 3 main ways: by grant; under a direct contract for services with ESFA; or through a funding agreement with the ESFA (where provision is delivered under a contract for services between a levy paying employer and an apprenticeships training provider, or advanced learner loan funded learning). Where the provider is continuing to receive public funding through any of these routes they should continue delivering this provision where feasible, including through remote delivery. They should not furlough staff whose salaries are paid from continuing Education and Skills Funding Agency (or any other public) income. This applies to both teaching and non-teaching staff. We recognise that many providers rely on funding from a mix of public sources and other income streams such as fees, employer contributions and commercial income. Where public income has reduced or non-public income has ceased or reduced, it may be appropriate for providers to seek support from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to furlough staff. Providers should only furlough employees if they meet the following conditions:  the employee works in an area of business where services are temporarily not required and whose salary is not covered by public funding the employee would otherwise be made redundant or laid off the employee is not involved in delivering provision that has already been funded (where appropriate) the employee is not required to deliver provision for a child of a critical worker and/or vulnerable child the grant from the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme would not duplicate other public grants received and would not lead to financial reserves being created  If it is difficult to distinguish whether staff are funded through continuing public funding, for the purposes of meeting the first 3 conditions listed above, then the total proportion of teaching and non-teaching staff (based on gross payroll) that are retained (for example, not furloughed) should, as a minimum, be equivalent to the continuing public income, as a proportion of all income that the provider usually receives. For example, if the only source of public funding is through a grant, and non-grant income makes up 25% of total income, then this should be the total maximum proportion of staff (based on gross payroll) that could be furloughed. Where providers consider furloughing staff, they should ensure that they take a fair and reasonable approach to part-time, sessional and temporary staff, reflective of good HR practice and legal requirements. Where a provider receives Adult Education Budget (AEB), or apprenticeship funding, as part of a direct contract for services with ESFA, and is at risk financially, they may be eligible for support (subject to meeting additional criteria) as part of DfE\u2019s response to the Cabinet Office\u2019s Procurement Policy Note 02/20. Support provided through that mechanism would count as public funding for the purposes of conditions covering the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Further guidance on the operation of any supplier relief scheme for providers funded under a contract for services with ESFA will be published when available. Providers should email ESFA.PPN220Queries@education.gov.uk to register their interest in the scheme. In instances where public funding is not delivered under a contract for services with the ESFA, the Cabinet Officer\u2019s Procurement Policy Note 02/20 is not applicable. The DfE is considering appropriate measures to monitor use of these schemes in order to detect any duplication of funding, and will be considering potential options to recover misused public funding as required. Some providers may also be eligible for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme.

They will want to refocus their teaching staff to support learners to come back into the classroom where this is appropriate and sustain the online offer that they have developed to continue ongoing learning since the decision to close educational settings was taken. The current proposals mean that a relatively small proportion of learners will return to face to face learning in the first instance and online learning can continue for the majority of learners. We know that this move will cause concern for some teachers who are having to shield or who have family members that are at risk. It is essential that in all of their planning, colleges and other providers continue to implement PHE advice on supporting those who are shielding or who are at risk. Teachers who fall into these categories should continue to be supported to take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their families including remaining at home should they need to. Colleges and other providers will be planning how they can best reintroduce more learners into their premises alongside those vulnerable learners and children of key workers who are already present on site. We know that there will be aspects of provision that cause concern to teachers, for example, use of limited space in classrooms or workshops for teaching or specific assessments of learners\u2019 competence. The guidance on social distancing will help colleges and other providers to make decisions about how to deploy teachers safely on their premises and to keep them safe when they are delivering face to face teaching or undertaking assessments that require practical demonstration. We are confident that providers will be able to make this transition work for their learners and staff, so that education can continue to be delivered in the most effective and safe way. Specific guidance for educational settings on social distancing and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will continue to be updated and should be used alongside this advice. What is most important is getting the balance right between the need for learners and teachers to be present onsite and making the best use of online teaching and learning. Any additional costs arising from increasing numbers of learners will be funded from existing college budgets. Colleges and other providers will also be seeking to recruit new teachers to fill existing vacancies and support delivery in future. We know that this will be a challenge in the current circumstances, particularly as teacher recruitment often includes a demonstration of teaching in the classroom, however we are confident that providers can find ways to recruit teachers using online delivery and other assessment methods where appropriate. Providers can still register for Round 3 of the Taking Teaching Further programme which is intended to support the recruitment of industry professionals to teaching roles in the FE sector. For those seeking support to recruit English, maths or SEND teachers we are still accepting applications for In-service ITE grants of \u00a318,200, which are available directly from the department.

Firstly, because there is moderately high scientific confidence in evidence suggesting younger children are less likely to become unwell if infected with coronavirus; and secondly because evidence shows the particularly detrimental impact which time spent out of education can have upon them. The three year groups within mainstream primary have been prioritised because they are key transition years \u2013 children in Reception and year 1 are at the very beginning of their school career and are mastering the essential basics, including counting and the fundamentals of reading and writing, and learning to socialise with their peers. We know that attending early education lays the foundation for lifelong learning and supports children\u2019s social and emotional development. Year 6 children are finishing Key Stage 2 and are preparing for the transition to secondary school, and will benefit immensely from time with their friends and teachers to ensure they are ready. From 1 June, as more children return to schools, we appreciate that each setting\u2019s circumstances will be slightly different. Any setting that cannot achieve the small groups recommended as part of the protective measures guidance should discuss options with their local authority or trust. If necessary, settings have the flexibility to focus first on continuing to provide places for priority groups and then, to support children\u2019s early learning, settings should prioritise groups of children as follows:  early years settings - 3 and 4 year olds followed by younger age groups infant schools - nursery (where applicable) and Reception primary schools - nursery (where applicable), Reception and year 1 ", "Rating": "Excellent", "Score": 4, "Average": 4.0}, {"Question": "I am due to move house.

A persistent cough or anosmia does not mean someone must continue to self-isolate for more than 7 days Should a household member develop coronavirus symptoms late in the 14-day household-isolation period (for example, on day 13 or day 14) the isolation period does not need to be extended, but the person with the new symptoms has to stay at home for at least 7 days. The 14-day household-isolation period will have greatly reduced the overall amount of infection the rest of the household could pass on, and it is not necessary to restart 14 days of isolation for the whole household. This will have provided a high level of community protection. Further isolation of members of this household will provide very little additional community protection. At the end of the 14-day period, any family member who has not become unwell can leave household isolation. See the explanatory diagram.

For those who are unable to leave the house, you could open the window for fresh air and do some indoor exercises to stay active.   Don\u2019t use smoking, eating, alcohol or other drugs to deal with your emotions. Stay connected with friends and family either by communicating with them by phone or internet if you can., If you live close to them and the local rules allow you to, you could also talk to them in person while keeping your distance. Keep a daily routine as much as possible. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same times every day, making sure you get enough sleep. Plan ahead and try to have a balance of activities such as keeping up with schoolwork, physical exercise, connecting with friends and family, doing things you enjoy, and eating regular meals.

In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks. For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be:  aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country. preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19   In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission.

Some may prioritize equality while others might put more emphasis on best outcomes or prioritization of the worst-off. For this reason, it is imperative that the different values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issues using a fair process. A fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain ethical values:  Transparency. In a transparent process, the decisions and their justifications should be made public. This means that the population should be informed about the criteria guiding the decisions. Inclusiveness. Those affected by allocation decisions \u2013 including individuals, communities or countries \u2013 should be able to exert at least some influence over the decision-making process as well as the decision itself.

This means that favouritism towards one\u2019s own family, religious or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. All forms of corruption that are at variance with this principle should be challenged and condemned.  Accountability. Those making decisions about allocation must be accountable for those decisions \u2013 that is, they should justify their decisions and be held responsible for them. A fair process means that allocation decisions should not be made by individuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case of allocation between countries, by a single country. Resources such as vaccines and therapies should not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation.

Probably the most up-to-date summary of scientific information we have on survival in the environment is from the European Centre for Disease control (ECDC) and the following is extracted from their recent technical report: Recent publications have evaluated the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces. According to van Doremalen et al., the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is up to three hours in the air post-aerosolization, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel, albeit with significantly decreased titres [3]. These findings are comparable with results obtained for environmental stability of SARS-CoV-1. These findings resulted from experiments in a controlled environment and should be interpreted with caution in the real-life environment. Moreover, different levels of environmental contamination have been detected in rooms of COVID-19 patients, ranging from 1 out of 13 to 13 out of 15 samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 before cleaning. No air samples were positive in these studies, but one sample from an air exhaust outlet was positive indicating that virus particles may be displaced by air and deposited on surfaces [4,5]. In a study of environmental contamination in a Chinese hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in environmental samples from the COVID-19 dedicated intensive care units (ICU), the COVID-19 dedicated obstetric isolation ward and the COVID-19 dedicated isolation ward. SARS-CoV-2 was also detected on objects such as the self- service printers used by patients to self-print the results of their exams, desktop keyboards and doorknobs. Virus was detected most commonly on gloves (15.4% of samples) and rarely on eye protection (1.7%) [6].

They should avoid touching people, surfaces and objects and be advised to cover their mouth and nose with a disposable tissue when they cough or sneeze and put the tissue in a bag or pocket and then dispose of the tissue in a bin. If they do not have any tissues available, they should cough and sneeze into the crook of their elbow. If they need to go to the bathroom whilst waiting for medical assistance, they should use a separate bathroom, if available. All surfaces that the infected employee has come into contact with must be cleaned. Alcohol based sanitizers/surface disinfectants should be used for cleaning purposes. In general, alcohol-based disinfectants (ethanol, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol) have been shown to significantly reduce infectivity of enveloped viruses like COVID-19 virus, in concentrations of 70-80%. Common disinfectants with active ingredients based on quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS) and chlorine would also have virucidal properties. All staff should wash their hands thoroughly for 20 seconds with soap and water after any contact with someone who is unwell with symptoms consistent with coronavirus infection. If an employee is confirmed as a case of COVID-19 it will be necessary to notify all close contacts of the infected employee so they too can take measures to minimise further risk of spread.

Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current scenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to different decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years. When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to which resources are overwhelmed in the current context. It would be inappropriate, for instance, to exclude population groups from being allocated a resource (for example, ventilators) at the outset of a pandemic when capacity remains. When resources are scarce, though \u2013 when there is an insufficient supply to meet everyone\u2019s needs \u2013 resource allocation should be guided by well established, broadly applicable ethical principles, unless there are characteristics of the outbreak that justify different courses of action.

Irrelevant characteristics of individuals, such as race, ethnicity, creed, ability or gender, should not serve arbitrarily as the basis for the differential allocation of resources. This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources by a lottery \u2013 that is, randomly by chance \u2013 or by a system of first come, first served. | May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources among individuals or populations who can be expected to derive the same benefit from the resource, for example, vaccines among high-risk populations, or ventilators among those with similar clinical indicators for benefit.   Best outcomes (utility)| This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources according to their capacity to do the most good or minimize the most harm, for example, using available resources to save the most lives possible. | May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources that confer substantially different benefits to different individuals, for example, ventilators to those expected to derive the most benefit.   Prioritize the worst off| This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those in greatest medical need or those most at risk. | May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources that are designed or intended to protect those at risk, for example, PPE for health care workers, vaccines for those most at risk of infection and severe illness, or those most in need, as in the case of provision of drugs in short supply to those needing them most urgently.   Prioritize those tasked with helping others | This principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources to those who have certain skills or talents that can save many other people, or because something is owed to them on account of their participation in helping others. | May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources to health care workers, first responders, etc.   Allocation principles may be relevant or justified at different stages of resource scarcity (from less scarcity to more scarcity). For example, where little scarcity exists, the allocation of resources such as ventilators may be most justified by the principle of first come, first served (which promotes the value of equality). When those resources become increasingly scarce, their allocation may be justified according to a principle that prioritizes those most in need. With even greater scarcity, a principle that aims to maximize benefit from the resource may be most justified. At each stage, allocation should aim to promote equality \u2013 that is, first come, first served, or random allocation, when no relevant factors distinguish individuals within a particular scheme of allocation (for example, among those with similar needs, or among those who can be expected to benefit similarly from the resources, or among those that are at similar levels of risk). In addition, multiple principles may be combined within an allocation scheme. For example, an allocation scheme for PPE might find its justification in a principle prioritizing those most at risk as well as a principle prioritizing those tasked with helping others, which would support priority allocation of PPE to health care workers.", "Rating": "Excellent", "Score": 4, "Average": 3.5}, {"Question": "How can health workers help women who are impacted by violence during COVID-19?", "Answer": "As a health worker, there are things you can do to help mitigate the impacts of violence on women and children at any time, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

These defensive measures have helped to limit some of the short-term impacts of the virus, and bought us time to translate what we have learned about the virus into solutions so that we can get back to a more familiar way of living. It is important that you continue to practise these measures and encourage your friends to do the same.

It is unknown if the immunosuppression of HIV will put a person at greater risk for COVID-19, thus, until more is known, additional precautions for all people with advanced HIV or poorly controlled HIV, should be employed[1],[2]. __ At present there is no evidence that the risk of infection or complications of COVID-19 is different among people living with HIV who are clinically and immunologically stable on antiretroviral treatment when compared with the general population. Some people living with HIV may have known risk factors for COVID-19 complications, such as diabetes, hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases and as such may have increased risk of COVID-19 unrelated to HIV. We know that during the SARS and MERS outbreaks there were only a few case reports of mild disease among people living with HIV. To date, there is a case report of a person living with HIV who had COVID-19 and recovered[3] and a small study on risk factors and antiretrovirals used among people living with HIV with COVID-19 from China. This study reported similar rates of COVID-19 disease as compared to the entire population and increased risk with older age, but not with low CD4, high viral load level or antiretroviral regimen[4]. Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and other comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension.

That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death.   Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection.", "Rating": "Excellent", "Score": 4, "Average": 3.5}, {"Question": "What are the similarities between COVID-19 and the flu?", "Answer": "The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.   Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre- symptomatic transmission \u2013transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms \u2013 is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.   The reproductive number \u2013 the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual \u2013 is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.   Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.   While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.   Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.   Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower.

Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:  Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 metre distance between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.  Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre.  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you.  Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.  Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.  If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area.

Gloves must be changed after carrying out non-food related activities such as opening/closing doors by hand, and emptying bins. Food workers should be aware that wearing gloves can allow bacteria to build up on the surface of the hands, so hand washing is extremely important when gloves are removed to avoid subsequent contamination of food. Food workers should not touch their mouth, nose and eyes when wearing gloves. Disposable gloves can give a false sense of safety and should not be used in the food work environment as a substitute for hand washing. The COVID-19 virus can contaminate disposable gloves in the same way it can get onto workers hands and contact surfaces. Removal of disposable gloves can lead to contamination of hands. Wearing disposable gloves can give you a false sense of security and may result in staff not washing hands as frequently as required. Handwashing is a greater protective barrier to infection than wearing of disposable gloves. Food businesses need to ensure adequate sanitary facilities are provided and ensure food workers thoroughly and frequently wash their hands. Soap and water is adequate for hand washing.

The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, undermined malaria control efforts and led to a massive increase in malaria- related illness and death in the 3 countries. A new modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published on 23 April, found that the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double this year alone if there are severe disruptions in access to insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medicines due to COVID-19. These projections reinforce the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria during the pandemic. In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers. WHO and partners have developed guidance on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment services in COVID-19 settings.", "Rating": "Excellent", "Score": 4, "Average": 4.0}, {"Question": "Can I reuse a disposable medical mask if I disinfect it?", "Answer": "Medical masks (also known as surgical masks): these are made from a minimum of three layers of synthetic nonwoven materials, and configured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middle. These masks are available in different thicknesses, have various levels of fluid-resistance and two levels of filtration. These medical masks reduce the transfer of saliva or respiratory droplets from the wearer to others and to the environment. They also decrease the likelihood of potentially infectious droplets from others reaching the mouth and nose of the mask wearer. Hand hygiene should be performed before putting on a clean mask and after removing the mask. These masks should be worn tightly around the chin and top of the nose. The wearer should avoid touching the mask while it is on the face and the mask should be immediately discarded if it becomes moist. Importantly, wearing a mask must be combined with other preventive measures including performing frequent and appropriate hand hygiene and physical distancing of at least 1 metre (3 feet). Respirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators --FFR) and available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99): these are specifically designed for healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where special medical procedures are undertaken. Respirators are intended to protect the wearer when these medical procedures aerosolize smaller particles than normal droplets into the air in the health treatment area.
